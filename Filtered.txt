15 Michael People say I am the best boss. They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious." "And you get the best out of us." [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.
16 Dwight [singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming]

20 Michael Whassup!
21 Dwight Whassup!
22 Michael Whass...up!
23 Dwight Whassup.

84 Jim Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?
85 Dwight What?
86 Jim What are you doing?
87 Dwight Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
88 Jim It's not on your desk.
89 Dwight It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
90 Dwight You can't do that.
91 Jim Why not?
92 Dwight Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
93 Jim [crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
94 Dwight Downsizing?
95 Dwight Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.

106 Michael Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
107 Dwight I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
108 Michael Assistant to the Regional Manager.
109 Dwight OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
110 Michael I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
111 Oscar Can't you just tell us.
112 Dwight Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
113 Michael You don't know what it is. [Laughs]
114 Dwight OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
115 Michael I don't need your permission.
116 Dwight Go ahead.

123 Stanley Can you promise that?
124 Dwight On his mother's grave.

132 Michael Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
133 Dwight Pam, information is power.

140 Michael Introduce yourself. Be polite.
141 Dwight Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
142 Michael Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
143 Dwight Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
144 Michael That's his profit.
145 Dwight New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
146 Dwight Damn it! Jim!
147 Michael OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
148 Dwight He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
149 Pam [Laughing]
150 Dwight That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
151 Dwight It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
152 Michael What is that?
153 Dwight That is my stapler.
154 Michael No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
155 Dwight OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
156 Jim How do you know it was me?
157 Dwight It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
158 Michael Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
159 Dwight Yeah.

164 Michael Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
165 Dwight OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.

234 Jim Do you really have to do that right now?
235 Dwight Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
236 Jim Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
237 Dwight Retaliation. Tit for tit.
238 Jim That is not the expression.
239 Dwight Well, it should be.

275 Michael You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
276 Dwight I have two. White and Indian.

281 Mr. Brown Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.
282 Dwight A few of the ground rules?
283 Michael Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
284 Dwight OK, can we steer away from gay people?
285 Mr. Brown Um...
286 Dwight I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
287 Mr. Brown Well, we only have an hour.
288 Dwight I figured it would save time.

309 Mr. Brown Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
310 Dwight Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
311 Mr. Brown Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?
312 Dwight A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
313 Mr. Brown OK.
314 Dwight A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
315 Mr. Brown Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
316 Dwight We all have a hero in our heart.

383 Michael No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
384 Dwight Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
385 Dwight Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
386 Pam That's nice, Dwight.
387 Dwight OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
388 Pam OK, I like your food.
389 Dwight Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I'm Australian, mate!
390 Michael Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
391 Pam OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.
392 Dwight Oh, man, am I a woman?

471 Jim Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.
472 Dwight Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
473 Jim Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.
474 Dwight OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
475 Michael Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
476 Dwight OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
477 Michael You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
478 Dwight [to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
479 Michael Nope, you cannot use it.
480 Dwight OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
481 Michael Temporary workspace. You can use it.
482 Dwight Thank you.
483 Michael If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.
484 Dwight What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
485 Dwight In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead." Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.

498 Pam Dwight, what...
499 Dwight Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
500 Jim It says "workspace".
501 Dwight Same thing.
502 Jim If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?
503 Dwight Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
504 Jim You are not my superior.
505 Dwight Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
506 Jim I thought it was a workspace?
507 Pam OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?
508 Dwight Yes. And my decision in final.
509 Pam This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.
510 Dwight Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
511 Jim You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
512 Dwight Sure.
513 Jim Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
514 Dwight Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
515 Jim OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
516 Dwight I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
517 Pam Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?
518 Dwight So I can lower it.

527 Michael Is it a good plan?
528 Dwight It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.

531 Michael Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
532 Dwight Yeah, you said...
533 Michael No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
534 Dwight I can handle that.

542 Michael Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him.
543 Dwight OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
544 Jim OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
545 Dwight OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.

567 Michael OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?
568 Dwight Damnit! Damnit Jim!
569 Dwight All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
570 Jim What are you talking about?
571 Dwight Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
572 Jim OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
573 Dwight Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
574 Dwight You did this, didn't you?
575 Jim Absolutely not.
576 Dwight Yes you did.
577 Jim No I didn't.
578 Dwight I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
579 Jim Killer nanorobots?
580 Pam It's an epidemic.
581 Dwight The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] "Count Choculitis"
582 Jim Sounds tough.
583 Dwight Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
584 Jim Do you?
585 Dwight I think you need to confess...
586 Jim Mmm hmm.
587 Dwight ...the fact...
588 Jim Yep.
589 Dwight What are you doing? Those are my keys.
590 Jim Good luck. [closes door and locks it]
591 Dwight Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]
592 Stanley [looks at keys, continues talking on phone] ...the light green or green...
593 Jim [answering phone] Jim Halpert.
594 Dwight Let me out.
595 Jim Who is this?
596 Dwight Let me out or you're fired.
597 Jim No, you can't fire me.
598 Dwight Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.

601 Jim Hey Pam! How are you?
602 Dwight Jim! Open the door!
603 Pam Good, how are you? Busy?
604 Jim I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
605 Dwight Jim!

609 Jim I have nothing to do.
610 Dwight Jim!
611 Pam Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.
612 Dwight Jim!

615 Jim The mall?
616 Dwight Jim!

619 Jan Hello?
620 Dwight Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
621 Jan This is Jan.
622 Dwight Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
623 Jan Who is this?
624 Dwight Dwight Schrute.
625 Jan From sales?
626 Dwight Well...
627 Jan Where's Michael Scott?
628 Dwight He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
629 Jan Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?
630 Dwight That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
631 Jan Really?
632 Dwight Yeah.
633 Jan OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.
634 Dwight Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
635 Jan No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.
636 Dwight Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]

643 Michael Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.
644 Dwight Michael. Michael?
645 Michael [under his breath] Oh, Christ.
646 Dwight I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
647 Dwight I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
648 Stanley What about confidentiality?
649 Dwight You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted pen1s.
650 Meredith Could you mean v*g1n*? Because if you do, I want that covered.
651 Dwight I thought your v*g1n* was removed during your hysterectomy?
652 Meredith A uterus is different from a v*g1n*. I still have a v*g1n*.
653 Dwight OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures?
654 Kevin That's a real thing.
655 Dwight Yeah, but no one here has it.

665 Michael Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
666 Dwight I most certainly did not.

674 Michael Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork." Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.
675 Dwight Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
676 Dwight Michael!?
677 Michael Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
678 Dwight I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
679 Michael There's no downsizing.
680 Dwight I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
681 Michael Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
682 Dwight Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
683 Michael Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?
684 Michael But there's no downsizing, so just don't...
685 Dwight Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
686 Michael Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
687 Michael It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired." [as Donald Trump] "You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed." It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] "You're foir-ed." I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But that's unrealistic, so...
688 Dwight It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
689 Stanley Why'd you do this?
690 Dwight I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?

719 Michael Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
720 Dwight Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
721 Dwight Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
722 Jim Absolutely, I do.
723 Dwight Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
724 Jim At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.
725 Dwight Did you get your tickets?
726 Jim To what?
727 Dwight The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep]
728 Jim And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, here's a way."
729 Dwight There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.

734 Jim Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
735 Dwight Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
736 Dwight Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
737 Jim What? No.
738 Dwight Just now.
739 Jim What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
740 Dwight Right, that's good, good, pursue this.
741 Jim Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
742 Dwight Mmm hmm.
743 Jim But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
744 Dwight Done.
745 Jim All right.
746 Michael [to the camera] Can you get her? She's right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers." Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael." [pretends to vomit and laughs]
747 Dwight They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?
748 Jim Yeah, what do you think that's about?
749 Dwight Only one way to find out.
750 Jim I'm on it.
751 Jim You are not going to believe this.
752 Dwight What? I believe it.
753 Jim Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
754 Dwight I could tell, from the body language.

759 Jim Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.
760 Dwight Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.
761 Jim Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
762 Dwight Oh, they're forming an alliance

766 Jim Their bread is very good.
767 Dwight Damn it. God!
768 Jim OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
769 Dwight God... Damn it! Why us?

789 Pam OK, yeah.
790 Dwight Jackpot.
791 Jim That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.
792 Michael [looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
793 Dwight Hey, you wanted to see me?
794 Michael Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
795 Dwight I don't think she'd be missed.
796 Michael There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
797 Dwight Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
798 Michael I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
799 Dwight She had a hysterectomy.
800 Michael [laughs] Which one is that again?
801 Dwight That's where they remove the uterus.
802 Michael Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
803 Dwight It could be kind of funny.
804 Michael You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
805 Jim OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.
806 Dwight Oh my God, we have to be there.
807 Jim I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
808 Dwight No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
809 Jim What? What?
810 Dwight I know. I know exactly what to do.
811 Jim [gives Dwight a high five] Great.
812 Dwight I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
813 Dwight This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.

817 Jim Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.
818 Dwight So tape it down.
819 Jim I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
820 Dwight Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.

829 Jim So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?
830 Dwight No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
831 Jim Right... That's good.
832 Dwight Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.

847 Pam [on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...
848 Dwight [box falls over] Oh.

914 Roy [looking at Dwight] An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?
915 Dwight I have absolutely no idea.
916 Roy Come on.
917 Dwight Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
918 Dwight [With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
919 Michael [to Jim] Hey, you ready?
920 Michael All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent.
921 Dwight Michael!
922 Michael Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea. Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, "This might be kinda fun." And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.
923 Michael Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.
924 Dwight Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
925 Michael No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
926 Dwight Oh, please.
927 Michael [to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game...
928 Dwight I apologized for that.
929 Michael [to Dwight] I vouched for you.
930 Dwight Michael, I...
931 Michael I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
932 Dwight I can handle that.
933 Michael Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.
934 Dwight And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
935 Michael Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.
936 Dwight [to camera] Same thing.
937 Michael No, it's not. It's lower, so...
938 Dwight It's close.
939 Dwight So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.

966 Michael I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
967 Dwight Gimli.
968 Michael Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
969 Dwight Just trying to be helpful.

992 Michael No, no, ridiculous.
993 Dwight Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can] Missed it...
994 Michael Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
995 Dwight Yes!
996 Michael Sorry Phyllis.
997 Dwight Can I be team captain?
998 Michael No, I'm team captain.
999 Dwight Can I be team manager?
1000 Michael No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
1001 Dwight Assistant team manager?
1002 Michael No.
1003 Dwight OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.

1049 Michael Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
1050 Dwight [taking off his shirt] OK, we'll be skins!
1051 Michael Aw, come on Dwight.
1052 Dwight What? Shirts on or off?
1053 Michael On. Just put it on.
1054 Dwight You sure?

1060 Michael Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. [Jim saves the ball from going out of bounds and passes to Michael] Here we go. Three! [Shoots and misses] Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!
1061 Dwight De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]

1084 Michael Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
1085 Dwight [scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!

1105 Michael Dwight!
1106 Dwight [scores] Yes!

1123 Angela This is a cold pack...
1124 Dwight Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]

1165 Jan We've created an incentive program to increase sales.
1166 Dwight Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?

1169 Jan At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
1170 Dwight It will just take a second.

1173 Jan Uh, yes. Yes you can.
1174 Dwight Just for a minute.

1177 Jan No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.
1178 Dwight Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.

1181 Michael Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
1182 Dwight Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
1183 Dwight s*x.
1184 Katy Both.
1185 Michael It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing.
1186 Dwight Torture.

1221 Michael Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
1222 Dwight Cocks in the henhouse.

1232 Katy You sit out there, don't you?
1233 Dwight So am I.

1236 Katy Okay, um...
1237 Dwight Doesn't matter.

1285 Jim What are you doing?
1286 Dwight The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.

1372 Jim She'd be perfect for you.
1373 Dwight Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
1374 Jim So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.
1375 Dwight Assistant to the Regional Manager.
1376 Jim Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.
1377 Dwight That's true.
1378 Jim Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.
1379 Dwight True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.

1382 Jim Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.
1383 Dwight What's that?
1384 Jim You buy a purse.
1385 Dwight I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
1386 Jim Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?
1387 Dwight No.
1388 Jim Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.
1389 Dwight Like those?
1390 Jim Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.
1391 Dwight Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...

1446 Michael I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
1447 Dwight It's actually better this way.
1448 Michael No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
1449 Dwight Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
1450 Michael No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
1451 Dwight Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
1452 Michael But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
1453 Dwight What?
1454 Michael She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
1455 Dwight Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
1456 Michael Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
1457 Dwight Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
1458 Michael No. I cannot promise you that.
1459 Dwight You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
1460 Michael Listen, Dwight.
1461 Dwight Do you love her?

1512 Jim Oh my God! You are so drunk!
1513 Dwight Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
1514 Jim Did you get that? Please tell me you got that. This is all going to be on.
1515 Michael Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
1516 Dwight Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.

1519 Michael And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.
1520 Dwight Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-

1523 Michael Oh, no you di-int.
1524 Dwight It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.

1531 Michael [in video] To Oscar Martinez it's the "Show Me the Money" award! Yeah!
1532 Dwight [struggling] Ahh! I can't-

1547 Michael [on video] ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...
1548 Dwight Watch your step.

1551 Phyllis Live and learn.
1552 Dwight Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.

1556 Pam I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.
1557 Dwight So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.

1560 Jim Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.
1561 Dwight So who are we laughing at?

1564 Jim Shoot.
1565 Dwight Who? Dave Barry?
1566 Kelly [laughing] No. No, just something that was written in the ladies' room wall.
1567 Pam Um, I just wanted to say thanks.
1568 Dwight What is it? Who wrote it?

1572 Jim Alright.
1573 Dwight That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.

1601 Phyllis Dwight, get out of here!!
1602 Dwight No, no, no, no...
1603 Phyllis What were you doing in the ladies room?!
1604 Dwight ...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
1605 Phyllis Why were you peering over the stalls?!
1606 Dwight No, why were you in there?!
1607 Phyllis You are a pervert!
1608 Dwight What were you doing in there?
1609 Phyllis You, are, a pervert!
1610 Dwight I am not.

1622 Michael Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.
1623 Dwight Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
1624 Pam You're taking away our bathroom?
1625 Dwight We are going to have two men's rooms.
1626 Phyllis But where would we...go?
1627 Dwight Be prepared to hold folks [Michael comes out of his office] From 9 am to...

1631 Michael Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
1632 Dwight Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
1633 Michael Just don't, don't talk-
1634 Dwight ...for people's behavior.
1635 Michael Don't talk-
1636 Dwight And it's-
1637 Michael Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
1638 Michael Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.
1639 Dwight [with a small fist pump] Yes!
1640 Michael Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.
1641 Dwight [clapping] Best Dundies ever.
1642 Dwight Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
1643 Dwight Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. [points] Devon!

1646 Michael "You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"
1647 Dwight The waitress tripped on the cord.

1656 Michael [to Dwight, in a low voice] Shut it. [normal voice] Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.
1657 Dwight Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
1658 Michael No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
1659 Dwight Yeah?
1660 Michael And I was about to take her bra off...
1661 Dwight Yeah!
1662 Michael ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
1663 Dwight Like an AIDS test?

1776 Pam Then we can go to dinner.
1777 Dwight So the monkey does the s*x thing right here! [monkey noises in background]

1780 Todd Packer There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis]
1781 Dwight Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?

1784 Michael No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
1785 Dwight Consider it?

1847 Michael Hey, send me that link to the monkey s*x video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.
1848 Dwight Yes!

1919 Michael I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
1920 Dwight Yeah, Meredith.
1921 Michael No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
1922 Dwight Yes.

1940 Michael That's what she sai [clears throat] Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
1941 Dwight Hey, Toby.
1942 Toby Hey Dwight.
1943 Dwight You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
1944 Toby Sure.
1945 Dwight Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female v*g1n* look like?
1946 Toby Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.
1947 Toby Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
1948 Dwight Good. Good. And...
1949 Toby I should get back to work.
1950 Dwight Okay.

2042 Michael Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
2043 Dwight What is going on?

2046 Michael Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
2047 Dwight That's my stopwatch.
2048 Michael Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.
2049 Jim [hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.
2050 Dwight Diversifying. Smart.

2053 Jim Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.
2054 Dwight And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.

2083 Michael You know.
2084 Dwight You should go.

2087 Michael Really?
2088 Dwight Uh huh.

2091 Jim These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one. [Michael stands on podium] Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal. [everyone claps]
2092 Dwight You have your lawyer there?

2095 Jim And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.
2096 Dwight Can I be your representative?
2097 Michael Get up here, Dwight.
2098 Michael I don't need a representative.
2099 Dwight Silver medal.
2100 Dwight I think I should be there.

2103 Jim Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
2104 Dwight I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.

2107 Jim Those are the doves.
2108 Dwight Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
2109 Michael Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.
2110 Dwight So you're taking a personal day?
2111 Michael Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
2112 Dwight Please, I'll make you proud.
2113 Michael Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
2114 Dwight Yes! As your representative?
2115 Michael As my associate.
2116 Dwight Same thing.
2117 Michael No it is not.
2118 Dwight I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart

2135 Michael Ok. See you soon.
2136 Dwight What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
2137 Michael I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
2138 Dwight [tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.
2139 Michael What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please...
2140 Dwight But then no one can see us.
2141 Michael I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
2142 Dwight Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.

2169 Michael Home, sweet home.
2170 Dwight Which one's yours?

2176 Michael Nice to meet you too.
2177 Dwight This is smaller than your old place.
2178 Michael Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
2179 Dwight Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for s*x.
2180 Carol Are we ready to sign some papers?
2181 Dwight Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.

2184 Michael Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
2185 Dwight Let's go check out the master bedroom.

2189 Michael This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.
2190 Dwight Oh. Terrible idea.
2191 Michael I'm putting my bed right over here.
2192 Dwight No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
2193 Michael Well, then I will get a warrantee.
2194 Dwight Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
2195 Michael Well then I won't get a warrantee.
2196 Dwight Shh Shh.
2197 Michael So that's the problem, is solved. What?
2198 Dwight Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.

2205 Carol And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.
2206 Dwight What kind of mortgage did you get?

2210 Carol Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.
2211 Dwight Ho, thirty years.
2212 Michael Ok, ok, ok.
2213 Dwight Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
2214 Michael Alright.
2215 Dwight Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
2216 Michael Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
2217 Dwight Well, this is it.

2220 Carol Actually yes.
2221 Dwight Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
2222 Michael Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
2223 Dwight We'll be here waiting for you.
2224 Michael Oh, man.
2225 Dwight A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.

2251 Michael I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.
2252 Dwight Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs]

2264 Michael There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.
2265 Dwight You didn't have to...
2266 Michael No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
2267 Michael Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.
2268 Dwight I don't even know what to say.
2269 Michael I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
2270 Dwight Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
2271 Michael What the hell is a terrarium?
2272 Dwight It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
2273 Michael Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
2274 Dwight Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.

2285 Jim Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
2286 Dwight Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
2287 Michael We take separate cars.
2288 Dwight Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
2289 Michael Why would we do that?
2290 Dwight Just for fun?
2291 Michael No.
2292 Dwight Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
2293 Michael EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.
2294 Dwight Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.

2305 Stanley A little bit more and I would have had it.
2306 Dwight You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.
2307 Michael Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
2308 Dwight People love beets.
2309 Michael Nobody likes beets.
2310 Dwight Everybody loves beets.
2311 Michael Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
2312 Dwight Let's get this roof going.
2313 Michael Stop it! [smacks Dwight's arm]
2314 Dwight Ow.

2332 Michael [in the background] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
2333 Dwight Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.

2357 Michael And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
2358 Dwight [coughing]
2359 Michael [to Ryan] [makes clicking noises like shooting a gun] Hey!
2360 Michael Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
2361 Dwight Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
2362 Dwight [coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
2363 Oscar [in background, on phone] But it says no late fee... .
2364 Michael Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
2365 Dwight [alarm sounds] People!
2366 Dwight That's exactly what I said.
2367 Angela Okay! Everybody!
2368 Michael Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
2369 Dwight This is not a test! Move to the exits!
2370 Dwight Were you absent?
2371 Angela Do not panic!
2372 Michael Toaster Oven 101?
2373 Dwight Head towards the exits.
2374 Dwight You failed?
2375 Angela Safety partners.
2376 Ryan I am so sorry.
2377 Dwight Get up off your desks!
2378 Michael Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.
2379 Angela Do not panic.
2380 Dwight I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire"] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
2381 Oscar [in phone] No, I don't hear it? Alright.
2382 Dwight and Michael [singing] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning---
2383 Dwight No, panic is warranted!
2384 Dwight Everybody!

2388 Ryan I can't believe I started the fire.
2389 Dwight This is not at drill!
2390 Dwight and Michael [sing gibberish to "We Didn't Start the Fire"]
2391 Angela Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!
2392 Dwight [singing] ... Marilyn Monroe!
2393 Dwight Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
2394 Dwight and Michael [singing] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning...
2395 Angela Go, let's go.
2396 Dwight Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
2397 Dwight This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
2398 Katy Hi!
2399 Dwight This is not a test! Can you leave?!

2402 Katy How are you?
2403 Dwight DO YOU WANT TO DIE?

2406 Katy I'm good. It's good to see you.
2407 Dwight Do you want to die? OUT!!

2410 Katy I'm hungry.
2411 Dwight STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?

2414 Katy Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.
2415 Dwight Move to the exits!

2418 Katy Um, for the... the desert island.
2419 Dwight We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! [Spots Kelly] Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!

2422 Katy Okay, um, first, Legally Blond.
2423 Dwight Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.

2426 Jim Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?
2427 Dwight Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!

2436 Katy Alright.
2437 Dwight Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?

2441 Ryan Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.
2442 Dwight Answer me this, though.
2443 Michael Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower.
2444 Ryan What?
2445 Dwight Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
2446 Dwight Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?

2450 Kevin Was it worth it?
2451 Dwight NO!
2452 Dwight Really?
2453 Ryan Okay... uh, sorry?
2454 Ryan I'm really sorry, Dwight.
2455 Dwight Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
2456 Dwight The fire guy! The fire guy!
2457 Michael Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
2458 Dwight [sings] Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!

2462 Michael Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.
2463 Dwight Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
2464 Michael I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.
2465 Michael Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
2466 Dwight That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...

2472 Jim Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.
2473 Dwight [to firemen] Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...

2484 Angela I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.
2485 Dwight Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question[/b]
2486 Jim I guess.
2487 Dwight Then I would bring an axe, no books.
2488 Jim Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.
2489 Dwight Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
2490 Jim Nice. Smart.
2491 Dwight ...hollowed out, inside[/b]

2506 Meredith ...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...
2507 Dwight Is this your car, Ryan?
2508 Michael Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
2509 Ryan [to Dwight] Don't...
2510 Dwight Good shocks.

2525 Michael Come on, egghead. Let's do it.
2526 Dwight Do it.

2531 Ryan Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?
2532 Dwight Keep an existing...

2535 Michael Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
2536 Dwight Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
2537 Michael Okay, Dwight.
2538 Dwight Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
2539 Michael You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.
2540 Dwight [scoffs] Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
2541 Michael For instance, why don't you go to business...
2542 Dwight [to Ryan] You should learn from him, right?
2543 Ryan I am.
2544 Dwight Right?
2545 Ryan I am.
2546 Michael Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
2547 Dwight Stupid!

2564 Jim Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.
2565 Dwight The Crow.

2582 Song Sometim... .
2583 Dwight Why didn't I go to business school?
2584 Jim Who goes to business school?
2585 Dwight The temp.
2586 Jim He does?
2587 Dwight Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
2588 Pam You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.
2589 Dwight He doesn't even know that I do that.
2590 Pam You should tell him.
2591 Dwight Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
2592 Pam Dwight.
2593 Jim What?
2594 Dwight I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
2595 Jim You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.
2596 Dwight Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
2597 Jim Yeah. You're right.
2598 Dwight Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.

2623 Michael Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...
2624 Dwight Would that make you happy?
2625 Michael What's that?
2626 Dwight If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
2627 Michael Yeah.
2628 Dwight I'm on it.

2704 Michael Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
2705 Dwight [eyeing Jim's costume] What is that?! What are you supposed to be?

2708 Jim Oh, yeah.
2709 Dwight Yeah, well look... [pulls his hood over his head and pops up his light saber] What about me?
2710 Phyllis What are you? A monk?
2711 Dwight I am a Sith Lord. [looks at Jim] Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.

2735 Michael Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
2736 Dwight Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH! [punches Jim in the chest and cracks up laughing]

2753 Michael Who do you think it should be?
2754 Dwight Jim. Definitely.
2755 Michael No, Jim brings in money.
2756 Dwight Phyllis.
2757 Michael Eh.
2758 Dwight Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
2759 Michael It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.
2760 Dwight One of the warehouse guys.
2761 Michael [turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
2762 Dwight Who is he saying?
2763 Michael You're right, I didn't even think of him.
2764 Dwight No, Michael.
2765 Michael Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
2766 Dwight No, not me.
2767 Michael Yeah... I could.
2768 Dwight Not Dwight.
2769 Michael I'm not saying that's what he said.
2770 Dwight I know that's what he said.
2771 Michael [listening to his head] What?
2772 Dwight Tell him, not Dwight.
2773 Michael That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
2774 Dwight Tell him to stop.
2775 Michael Are you kidding?
2776 Dwight Quiet, you.
2777 Michael I agree. He'd land on his feet.
2778 Dwight Make him be quiet.

2788 Jim Um... Whoa. [picks up ringing phone][in managerial voice] Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.
2789 Dwight Stanley, could you come with me, please.
2790 Stanley No.
2791 Dwight As Assistant Regional Manager...
2792 Stanley To the.
2793 Dwight Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. [Stanley laughs.] I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry.
2794 Stanley [laughs, and imitates Donald Trump] You're fired. Get your fingers off my phone.
2795 Michael So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?
2796 Dwight He wouldn't listen to me
2797 Michael Ahh, come on.
2798 Dwight If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
2799 Michael I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]
2800 Dwight [whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
2801 Dwight Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.

2804 Oscar Oh. [fixes his dress]
2805 Dwight [on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]

2811 Pam Jim...
2812 Dwight This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
2813 Michael Oh, God.
2814 Dwight I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
2815 Michael Fantastic!
2816 Dwight And I turned it down.
2817 Michael What?! That would've solved all my problems.
2818 Dwight Out of loyalty to this company...
2819 Michael Oh, you idiot.
2820 Dwight ... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
2821 Michael If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
2822 Dwight But then you wouldn't have me here.
2823 Michael Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?
2824 Dwight It's in Maryland.
2825 Michael You can call. Can you call 'em?
2826 Dwight I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.

2902 Michael Well, maybe I did.
2903 Dwight Where is my desk?

2906 Stanley Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.
2907 Dwight This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional.

2910 Michael Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
2911 Dwight I didn't lose my desk.

2914 Michael I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
2915 Dwight Okay, who moved my desk?

2918 Stanley I don't care.
2919 Dwight Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
2920 Michael I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?
2921 Jim Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot.
2922 Dwight Of course.
2923 Dwight [In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
2924 Michael And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
2925 Jim [On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
2926 Dwight Michael, I don't know...
2927 Dwight Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
2928 Michael I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.
2929 Jim I know.
2930 Dwight I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
2931 Dwight It's by the ream?
2932 Michael No, no, title change only.
2933 Jim Uh, yeah, ream.
2934 Dwight I'll have Pam send out a memo.
2935 Dwight ...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
2936 Michael No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.
2937 Jim Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
2938 Dwight Just a formality.
2939 Dwight Wash your hands, Kevin.
2940 Michael Absolutely but not really.
2941 Jim [On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second...
2942 Dwight Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
2943 Dwight [Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
2944 Michael Yes you do.
2945 Jim Umm...
2946 Dwight Thank you, Sensei.
2947 Dwight Dwight...

2950 Michael I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.
2951 Dwight Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
2952 Jim Was that your mom?
2953 Dwight No, that was my Sensei.
2954 Jim Oh, I thought it was your mom.
2955 Dwight I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
2956 Jim Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.
2957 Dwight Assistant Sensei.
2958 Jim Ok.
2959 Dwight I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.

3000 Jim Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?
3001 Dwight Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
3002 Jim No I'm not.
3003 Dwight Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
3004 Jim Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this[/b]
3005 Dwight Ok, give that back to me.
3006 Jim Ok, say please.
3007 Dwight No. That is not a toy.
3008 Jim Please?
3009 Dwight Please?
3010 Jim Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.
3011 Dwight Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
3012 Michael And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.
3013 Pam Could you practice on the forms?
3014 Dwight No women or children, unless provoked.
3015 Jim Ok, Roy?
3016 Dwight Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
3017 Jim Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?
3018 Michael Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.
3019 Dwight Because we're friends.

3033 Michael Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
3034 Dwight Argggg!

3041 Jim You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
3042 Dwight What belt are they?
3043 Michael Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...
3044 Dwight No!
3045 Michael ... he cried at the end of it. He did.
3046 Dwight Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
3047 Michael Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
3048 Dwight Ok, I'll punch you.
3049 Michael Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
3050 Dwight Kiyah!
3051 Michael Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
3052 Dwight Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
3053 Jim Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?
3054 Michael Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you.
3055 Dwight I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.

3062 Jim Yes.
3063 Dwight [to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.

3077 Kelly Hi-yah!
3078 Dwight Good.
3079 Kelly Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.
3080 Dwight Now watch, let me take you from behind.
3081 Kelly What?
3082 Michael Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
3083 Dwight I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.
3084 Michael No, Really?
3085 Dwight In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
3086 Michael Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
3087 Dwight Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
3088 Michael Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches[/b]
3089 Dwight No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
3090 Michael Really?
3091 Dwight Yeah.

3094 Michael No, they must have class.
3095 Dwight No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
3096 Michael Look...
3097 Dwight I've got the key.

3118 Ira Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?
3119 Dwight Yes, Sensei!
3120 Michael Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
3121 Ira Shi mate!
3122 Dwight Hiii! [kicks Michael]

3125 Michael What the hell was that?
3126 Dwight Yes!
3127 Ira Dwight - awarded a point.
3128 Michael No.
3129 Dwight Eat it!
3130 Michael Alright, that's the way you want it.
3131 Dwight Two more.

3134 Michael I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
3135 Dwight No.
3136 Michael I got his pants.
3137 Dwight It was my pants.

3142 Ira Ok, break. Break.
3143 Dwight No holding.
3144 Michael You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie]
3145 Dwight No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
3146 Michael Open your mouth.
3147 Dwight No, Michael!

3152 Michael [knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
3153 Dwight I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
3154 Ryan Ok, to what?
3155 Dwight Just put "The Hospital." Contact number[/b]

3169 Michael This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
3170 Dwight I'm busy.

3216 Michael Ok, let's do this thing. [to Pam] Wish us luck.
3217 Dwight Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.

3305 Jim Oh yeah-
3306 Dwight Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
3307 Jim Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
3308 Dwight You took something that doesn't belong to you.
3309 Jim Dwight-
3310 Dwight Brought it in here-
3311 Jim Do you want to play-
3312 Dwight Made copies of it-

3327 Phyllis Sir, you have some messages.
3328 Dwight Not now!
3329 Phyllis They're important.
3330 Dwight Ok, what are they?
3331 Phyllis First message is[/b]
3332 Dwight Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!
3333 Dwight Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good.
3334 Dwight If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
3335 Ryan Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.
3336 Dwight Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission. [Pam gets up to talk to Roy]

3339 Jim Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
3340 Dwight Pow! Pow! Pow!

3344 Oscar Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?
3345 Dwight Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage.
3346 Ryan I forget it, brutha.
3347 Dwight Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt. [out of character] Wait, who's Dwigt?
3348 Pam Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops.
3349 Dwight D-W-I-G-H-T.
3350 Dwight Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end.
3351 Jim Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-
3352 Dwight Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.

3401 Michael Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. [nervous laugh] Oh-ok.
3402 Dwight [waking up on office couch] Michael? Michael? [goes into Michael's office] Michael? [looks out Michael's window] His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. [taxi pulls into Dunder-Mifflin parking lot] Who's this? Jan?

3405 Michael Hello, Dwight.
3406 Dwight Did you do her?
3407 Michael Who.
3408 Dwight Jan Levinson-Gould.
3409 Michael Uh, no, no, no Gould.
3410 Dwight Did you do her?
3411 Michael This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
3412 Dwight And she is your boss.

3424 Pam Why might some say that?
3425 Dwight [bouncing on an exercise ball] You should get one of these.

3428 Jim Yeah, no, I don't think you can.
3429 Dwight Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.

3432 Michael Wait.
3433 Dwight This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. [knocks things around Jim's desk] Sorry.

3436 Michael Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
3437 Dwight Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable s*x.

3440 Michael Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?
3441 Dwight Plus, improves your reflexes [knocks over more stuff] see, I would have caught that.

3444 Michael Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?
3445 Dwight It's only twenty-five bucks.

3481 Pam Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.
3482 Dwight [running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!

3485 Michael Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. [plays Jan's message] "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you".
3486 Dwight Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review.
3487 Jim Ok.
3488 Dwight Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
3489 Jim We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
3490 Dwight Oh, yes, we do.
3491 Jim No, we don't.
3492 Dwight Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
3493 Jim Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
3494 Dwight Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you?
3495 Jim I win.
3496 Dwight Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid.
3497 Jim Wait, wait
3498 Dwight Uh, duh.

3554 Jim [on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11
3555 Dwight Saturday.

3595 Jim No, that was unbelievable.
3596 Dwight Who? Who was it? Who did he fire?
3597 Pam You didn't see it?
3598 Dwight No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night

3608 Michael Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one[/b]
3609 Dwight What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
3610 Kelly I thought you read these every week.
3611 Michael Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.
3612 Dwight It happens occasionally.

3615 Michael Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
3616 Dwight Tom?

3619 Michael Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion.
3620 Dwight Next suggestion.
3621 Michael Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O."
3622 Dwight You need to do something about your B.O.

3627 Michael Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath"-
3628 Dwight You need-
3629 Michael Ok.
3630 Dwight To do something about-

3637 Michael Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
3638 Dwight Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
3639 Michael Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
3640 Dwight Next suggestion.
3641 Michael "Don't sl-", ok, that's blank [Dwight picks up note] Don't, just put it-
3642 Dwight "Don't sleep with your boss"? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?

3652 Michael Where did you get your outfit?
3653 Dwight [loud metal music playing in a stairwell

3656 Michael Look-
3657 Dwight Michael?
3658 Michael Oh my God...
3659 Dwight I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God
3660 Jan No, Dwight
3661 Dwight Great.
3662 Michael What do you want Dwight?
3663 Dwight I am ready for my performance review.

3666 Michael You wanna talk now, good
3667 Dwight Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
3668 Michael Why on earth would we give you a raise?
3669 Dwight That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word[/b]
3670 Michael You do? How do you get in?
3671 Dwight I have a copy of your key.

3674 Jan Oh! Michael, for God sakes!
3675 Dwight I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
3676 Michael Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?
3677 Dwight For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
3678 Michael That was deer!? Gross, oh!
3679 Dwight You liked it!
3680 Michael Oh, did not!
3681 Dwight Jan, have you ever had deer?
3682 Jan No.
3683 Dwight It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.

3688 Jan Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. [digs a cigarette out of her purse] Do you have a light?
3689 Dwight And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said "Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of".
3690 Michael That's from Superman?
3691 Dwight Smallville. And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.

3721 Bill Ok.
3722 Dwight Mi-

3725 Phyllis [singing] Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known...
3726 Dwight Sorry.

3729 Pam Oh, yeah I gave that up.
3730 Dwight Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing?

3733 Pam Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.
3734 Dwight You have to tell me.

3737 Kevin [singing] Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.
3738 Dwight Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
3739 Dwight Surprise! [laughs] Everybody!
3740 Michael Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr! That's strong!
3741 Phyllis Dwight...
3742 Dwight Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-

3745 Michael Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. [singing] Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---
3746 Dwight Or get hit by a car-

3749 Michael We're making love!
3750 Dwight Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.

3768 Michael Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
3769 Dwight So it's true? You have access to our e-mails?

3773 Kevin I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.
3774 Dwight Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
3775 Angela I know.
3776 Dwight Good. [Pam overhears]

3787 Pam Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.
3788 Dwight Nice.
3789 Pam One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?
3790 Dwight Does he have access to their medical records?
3791 Pam Ummmm...
3792 Dwight I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.

3813 Pam [to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!
3814 Dwight Question[/b]
3815 Jim Oh, uh, no. Could-
3816 Dwight I was wondering-
3817 Jim Could, keep that down.
3818 Dwight Why?
3819 Jim Because not everybody knows about the party.
3820 Dwight Like who? Who doesn't know?
3821 Jim Umm, Michael.
3822 Dwight Why just Michael?
3823 Jim Because it's a surprise.
3824 Dwight Is it?
3825 Jim Uh hmm.
3826 Dwight Oh, that's perfect!
3827 Jim So, don't tell.
3828 Dwight I won't.

3875 Michael Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
3876 Dwight Battlestar Galatica.
3877 Michael That's, whatever stupid show you want-
3878 Dwight I can't-
3879 Michael To watch tonight
3880 Dwight Tonight.
3881 Michael We're watching it.
3882 Dwight Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice.
3883 Michael I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.
3884 Dwight Clarinet.
3885 Michael You, too, Dwight?
3886 Dwight Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera] He has no idea!
3887 Jim Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.
3888 Dwight Jim! You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
3889 Mark Hey, you must be Dwight!
3890 Dwight You don't work with us.
3891 Jim That's because Mark's my roommate.
3892 Mark Hey, I love the Birkenstocks.
3893 Dwight Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions. Jim, come here.
3894 Jim Uh hmm.
3895 Dwight When is the guest of honor coming?
3896 Jim Oh, uh, later-ish.
3897 Dwight He's gonna love it!

3972 Angela I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine. [Pam overhears]
3973 Dwight Go. Get the door.
3974 Jim I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
3975 Michael Here we are.
3976 Dwight This is so awesome.
3977 Dwight Go. Push!
3978 Michael Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.
3979 Michael Oh god.
3980 Dwight Thank you.
3981 Dwight Push!

3984 Todd Packer [grabbing Michael around the neck] Merry Christmas, asswipe!
3985 Dwight Really shove it.

3988 Todd Packer [rapping] What's up my nerds. Check it out. [points at the mistletoe stuck down his pants]
3989 Dwight Shove it through! Break it!

3994 Michael Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.
3995 Dwight I got a splinter.

3998 Michael Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.
3999 Dwight I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.

4002 Michael No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
4003 Dwight One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]

4019 Angela Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?
4020 Dwight Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?

4023 Angela We'll see.
4024 Dwight You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.

4033 Michael It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.
4034 Dwight Yes.

4042 Michael Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?
4043 Dwight You guys should use a hand truck.

4046 Michael Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
4047 Dwight No.

4059 Michael Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.
4060 Dwight Michael, I would like to be the elf.
4061 Michael That makes sense because he has elfish features.
4062 Dwight [now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.

4076 Michael It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
4077 Dwight Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
4078 Stanley I know how to plug something in.
4079 Dwight I want to do it.

4084 Pam I think the tree looks nice.
4085 Dwight Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
4086 Michael No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.
4087 Michael Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."
4088 Dwight First present, Oscar.

4091 Oscar Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..
4092 Dwight Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.

4098 Creed Yep. That's exactly what happened.
4099 Dwight Pam.
4100 Pam [opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.
4101 Jim There's a little more to it.
4102 Dwight All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]

4111 Michael What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
4112 Dwight Michael.

4117 Kevin Should we just keep opening up the presents?
4118 Dwight We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.

4135 Ryan And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?
4136 Dwight Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.

4142 Kelly That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.
4143 Dwight Angela, you're up.

4149 Meredith Damn it.
4150 Dwight Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.
4151 Meredith I really want the iPod.
4152 Dwight It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.

4157 Michael [opens present] "In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."
4158 Dwight You and me, Michael. Yes!
4159 Michael Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
4160 Dwight I never said it was better than an iPod.
4161 Dwight Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
4162 Dwight [shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!

4165 Kevin That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. [pauses] Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.
4166 Dwight Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.

4174 Kelly Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.
4175 Dwight Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
4176 Jim Got to be kidding me.
4177 Dwight Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.

4193 Jim I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?
4194 Dwight No trades.
4195 Jim Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
4196 Dwight "A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane. Titanic.
4197 Jim Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
4198 Dwight No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
4199 Jim You don't even drink tea.
4200 Dwight True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
4201 JIm Okay ..
4202 Dwight .. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]

4256 Jim Hey.
4257 Dwight Hello. Jim?
4258 Jim What's up, buddy?
4259 Dwight This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
4260 Jim Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
4261 Dwight Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
4262 Jim Who, Steve?
4263 Dwight Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
4264 Pam Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.
4265 Dwight No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
4266 Pam Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.
4267 Dwight Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
4268 Pam I love these.
4269 Dwight Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?
4270 Jim Oh, there it is. J1.
4271 Dwight But I don't have any...
4272 Jim Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.
4273 Dwight [putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
4274 Michael Hello, everyone.
4275 Dwight Good morning, Michael.

4334 Michael The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
4335 Dwight Aye aye, Captain.
4336 Michael [singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.
4337 Michael Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.
4338 Dwight Cool.

4383 Michael So, okay.
4384 Dwight Limbo, whoo!

4387 Captain Jack Okay...
4388 Dwight Me! Me, me, me.
4389 Captain Jack Uh... usually it's a woman.
4390 Dwight I'm stronger.
4391 Captain Jack Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?
4392 Captain Jack Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!
4393 Dwight I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.

4398 Michael Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.
4399 Dwight [singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
4400 Angela Hey, come inside and talk to me.
4401 Dwight I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!

4422 Captain Jack Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.
4423 Dwight Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
4424 Michael Okay.
4425 Dwight Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.

4450 Meredith Wow!
4451 Dwight Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.

4476 Michael Never, ever, ever give up.
4477 Dwight Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.

4481 Jim [off camera] Yeah, that's right.
4482 Dwight Want to take a rake... .

4485 Michael Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.
4486 Dwight Ahh!

4491 Pam Ok, wait wait wait wait...
4492 Dwight Ok, Pam, thanks.

4495 Pam Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!
4496 Dwight You're the best.

4501 Pam Ok...
4502 Dwight It smells like chicken soup.

4505 Pam Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.
4506 Dwight I have to go to the hospital.

4509 Jim I'm sorry? Pam.
4510 Dwight Where we going?

4513 Jim What is going on?
4514 Dwight I'll be back, I mean...

4517 Michael OH GOD!
4518 Dwight Why?

4521 Michael Oh God!
4522 Dwight Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose]

4525 Michael OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
4526 Dwight [giggles]

4529 Michael I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.
4530 Dwight Oh, huggy hugs.

4543 Michael I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
4544 Dwight Where are we going?
4545 Michael [panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?
4546 Jim Come on, get inside.
4547 Dwight [silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?
4548 Dwight Where are we going?

4552 Michael Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
4553 Dwight I'm coming Michael!

4556 Michael I know, just sayin'.
4557 Dwight I'm gonna save you!
4558 Michael Dwight, what are you drinking?
4559 Michael Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.
4560 Dwight I found it under the seat.
4561 Dwight Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
4562 Jim Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
4563 Michael I don't want Dwight!
4564 Dwight I'm thirsty.

4567 Michael I don't have a girlfriend.
4568 Dwight No!

4571 Michael It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.
4572 Dwight I'm thirsty!

4575 Pam What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window]
4576 Dwight No.

4579 Pam Ohhhhhh!
4580 Dwight You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!

4583 Jim It's broken right, he can't...
4584 Dwight No. [takes a drink]

4593 Jim He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
4594 Dwight [drinks] Mmmmm...

4603 Pam No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.
4604 Dwight My eyes!

4607 Michael Please stop popping my cast. Thank you.
4608 Dwight My eyes!

4611 Michael Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...
4612 Dwight Danger.
4613 Dwight Your foot?

4624 Jim So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
4625 Dwight [holding mini-fan] It slipped.

4628 Jim Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight]
4629 Dwight Sorry.
4630 Dwight Hi Michael!

4633 Michael I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.
4634 Dwight Ahhh. Mweehaa

4638 Doctor A head injury.
4639 Dwight Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.

4642 Doctor [to Dwight] So, I'm ordering a CAT scan.
4643 Dwight What?
4644 Dwight What is that?
4645 Michael You just said "part of your duties are to" something.
4646 Michael Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
4647 Dwight No, I didn't.

4650 Michael Ok, what kinda machine is that?
4651 Dwight What is wrong with you?
4652 Doctor Does the skin look red and swollen?
4653 Michael Where is my cornbread?
4654 Dwight That's what she said.

4665 Michael Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
4666 Dwight I don't want to do this.

4669 Michael And they had no yams?
4670 Dwight Oh.

4674 Pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
4675 Dwight Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?

4678 Pam Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?
4679 Dwight Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.

4682 Pam I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.
4683 Dwight Oh, no no no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.

4686 Pam Really? Michael went in with him?
4687 Dwight Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!

4690 Pam Wow.
4691 Dwight Why would they all be...? Ok, see you later, Pan.

4713 Michael Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
4714 Dwight These covers are totally indestructible.
4715 Pam Really?
4716 Dwight Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player]
4717 Dwight Oh no, it's broken.
4718 Pam What?!
4719 Dwight No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long.
4720 Pam That is so cool. Thanks Dwight!
4721 Dwight Yep.

4724 Michael No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?
4725 Dwight Huh. Do you like candy?
4726 Angela It's alright.
4727 Dwight Cause you're sweeter than candy.

4759 Michael [sigh] I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
4760 Dwight [looking up at Creed] Dad?

4821 Michael Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.
4822 Dwight [hits his head on his desk] Uh, ugh, ohhhh...

4827 Angela I, barely know him...
4828 Dwight I want Michael to take me...

4834 Jim Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator.
4835 Dwight Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
4836 Jim What are you doing? What, stop...
4837 Dwight Vietnam sounds.
4838 Jim [Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.
4839 Dwight Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter]

4876 Michael Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?
4877 Dwight What's up-dog?
4878 Michael Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
4879 Dwight Good. How are you doing?

4882 Michael Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January
4883 Dwight Empty mind.
4884 Michael No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.
4885 Dwight Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
4886 Angela He's out sick.
4887 Dwight That's unacceptable.
4888 Angela I agree it's unacceptable. [longing look]
4889 Kevin Whhh... What are you guys doing?
4890 Dwight Michael.
4891 Michael Yes.
4892 Dwight Oscar is out sick.
4893 Michael On a Friday? [Dwight nods]
4894 Dwight Can I do some of the talking?
4895 Michael I will do all the talking.
4896 Dwight Ok, let him know that I'm here.

4900 Michael Hi, Oscar its Michael.
4901 Dwight And Dwight.

4905 Oscar Yeah, I feel terrible about it.
4906 Dwight Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.

4910 Oscar I feel nauseous and my heads killing.
4911 Dwight Checks out.

4914 Oscar I'll just be sleep--- [Michael hangs up the phone before Oscar can finish]
4915 Dwight Ok. First impressions?
4916 Michael He sounded sick.
4917 Dwight Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
4918 Michael That's exactly what I was thinking.
4919 Dwight Question? May I investigate?

4940 Michael [singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us...
4941 Dwight Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it?
4942 Ryan Yeah, I think I can handle it.
4943 Dwight Do you think? Or do you know?
4944 Ryan I think.
4945 Dwight [low] Oh God, here.

4960 Michael [Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
4961 Dwight Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
4962 Dwight There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.

4965 Michael Not so much.
4966 Dwight Ok, what is going on here?
4967 Michael Nothing.
4968 Dwight Oh, really nothing? Fact
4969 Michael Fact
4970 Dwight Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
4971 Jim Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
4972 Dwight Is that true?
4973 Michael Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
4974 Dwight Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.
4975 Michael Ok.
4976 Dwight I can tell. I won't let you down.

5000 Dana Great.
5001 Dwight Who took all the black ones?
5002 Pam That's a communal bowl.
5003 Dwight So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
5004 Pam Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.
5005 Dwight Sniffling how?
5006 Pam Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?
5007 Dwight Three.
5008 Pam Ok, it was the second one.
5009 Dwight Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it?

5034 Pam I hate you.
5035 Dwight Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
5036 Michael Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
5037 Dwight Including prep time?

5061 Michael You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
5062 Dwight As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.

5088 Jim Ok.
5089 Dwight Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
5090 Gil Who's this?
5091 Dwight This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
5092 Gil Gil.
5093 Oscar Are you going to tell Michael?
5094 Dwight How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
5095 Dwight Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.

5162 Michael [as cleaning lady with mask leaves] Here she comes. All cleaned? Great. [walks into office]
5163 Dwight [coughing] It's still stinky.
5164 Michael That is worse.
5165 Dwight She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation.

5190 Michael [putting his feet on desk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen.
5191 Dwight [putting his feet on desk] Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
5192 Michael Don't ape me.
5193 Dwight Okay.
5194 Michael This is great.
5195 Dwight Yeah!
5196 Michael The pressures of my office are insane.
5197 Dwight [agreeing] Mm.
5198 Michael I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here.
5199 Dwight No way!
5200 Michael Yeah.
5201 Dwight And who had your office?

5204 Michael You know who used to sit at that desk?
5205 Dwight That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
5206 Michael Mm-mm. Todd Packer.
5207 Dwight No!
5208 Michael Yeah.
5209 Dwight I thought he was out on the road.
5210 Michael He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
5211 Dwight Ah.

5231 Michael [whispering] Dwight.
5232 Dwight [whispering] Michael.
5233 Michael Let's send up Accounting.
5234 Dwight What?

5240 Michael and Dwight [as they throw accountants' files and supplies around] Ahhhh! Whoo hoo! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Sales rules!
5241 Dwight Yeah! [laughing]
5242 Michael Yeah! Oh ho ho [laughing]
5243 Dwight Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
5244 Michael No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that.
5245 Dwight Okay.

5251 Michael You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.
5252 Dwight [on phone] Hello, am I the 107th caller? [hangs up, dials again] Hello, Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and dials again] Hell , Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? [hangs up and begins to dial again] I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
5253 Michael Stop.
5254 Dwight Jethro Tull...
5255 Michael Stop it. [Dwight hangs up] Stop. It. [Dwight beings to dial] Don't. Don't.
5256 Dwight I need to make a sales call. Please?
5257 Michael All right.
5258 Dwight [on phone, whispering] Am I the 107th caller?

5273 Michael Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?
5274 Dwight Yeah!

5277 Michael Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
5278 Dwight It is so on!
5279 Michael God, this is gonna be fun.
5280 Dwight Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!

5299 Michael You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
5300 Dwight But you're the one who picked today.

5414 Michael I'm just going to put this over there.
5415 Dwight It's a terrible idea.

5418 Michael You did uh... okay.
5419 Dwight Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.

5426 Michael Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
5427 Dwight Yeah!

5439 Michael We have nowhere else Jan. This...
5440 Dwight We could do it in the warehouse.

5443 Michael Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.
5444 Dwight Remember on Lost when they met the Others?

5484 Michael Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
5485 Dwight Okay. Let's go. Step up.

5494 Jan Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.
5495 Dwight Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
5496 Jim Ponies.
5497 Dwight No.
5498 Ryan How about rainbows?
5499 Dwight No.

5550 Guy It totally sucks.
5551 Dwight Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like "Gas ain't free!"

5554 Darryl No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?
5555 Dwight Not literally.

5560 Darryl But we get paid a lot less.
5561 Dwight Word.

5651 Michael Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
5652 Dwight And you want me to come with you.
5653 Michael Nope. The opposite of that.
5654 Dwight I will stay here and run things on this end.
5655 Michael Ok, good.
5656 Dwight Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
5657 Michael I probably will, why do you ask?
5658 Dwight Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
5659 Michael Yeah.
5660 Dwight Screwed.

5669 Jim So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
5670 Dwight What's this? What is this?
5671 Jim I dunno, it's on your desk.
5672 Dwight Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
5673 Jim It was there when I sat down.
5674 Dwight [opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!

5696 Michael This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
5697 Dwight Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
5698 Angela Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
5699 Dwight Oh I did. I did.
5700 Angela I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
5701 Dwight Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.

5723 Michael Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]
5724 Dwight Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
5725 Pam You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
5726 Dwight No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
5727 Pam You need to get something for your girlfriend.
5728 Dwight [same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
5729 Pam Tightly wound?
5730 Dwight (smirking) Exactly.
5731 Pam Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
5732 Dwight You mean, like a ham?
5733 Pam No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
5734 Dwight Ok, I get it.
5735 Pam That you remember her.
5736 Dwight Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]

5812 Michael I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
5813 Dwight Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.

5842 Michael Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
5843 Dwight They are either going to say yes... or no.
5844 Michael Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
5845 Dwight Think it through.

5851 Creed Ryan!
5852 Dwight Fumble! Yaaah!
5853 Michael Hey, Dwight.
5854 Dwight Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
5855 Michael You all right Ryan?
5856 Dwight Ryan.
5857 Ryan Yeah.
5858 Michael Pam!
5859 Dwight Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
5860 Jim Cugino's pizza.
5861 Dwight Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question

5873 Michael That's what she said!
5874 Dwight Ha! I don't get it.
5875 Michael Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
5876 Dwight Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
5877 Michael Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
5878 Michael Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
5879 Dwight What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very..."
5880 Michael That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
5881 Dwight When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
5882 Dwight I can't do this.
5883 Michael That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
5884 Dwight Oh, okay.
5885 Michael But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
5886 Dwight Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
5887 Michael Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
5888 Dwight I'll try and think of one. When...
5889 Michael Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
5890 Dwight Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?

5897 Michael [stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
5898 Dwight Saleswoman has a v*g1n*.
5899 Michael It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a s*x Ed class.
5900 Dwight But I'm right?
5901 Michael Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
5902 Dwight Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
5903 Michael I do. Both of them.
5904 Dwight Could I have a copy of one of them?
5905 Michael No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
5906 Michael Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
5907 Dwight Yeah!

5910 Michael You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
5911 Dwight That is so great about the bonus!

5914 Phyllis It's unbelievable!
5915 Dwight Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
5916 Pam Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
5917 Dwight Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
5918 Stanley Why would this affect our bonuses?
5919 Dwight They are unrelated.
5920 Kelly Is Brad okay?
5921 Dwight He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
5922 Oscar What the hell is going on here?
5923 Angela Are we out of jobs?
5924 Dwight Yes.

5954 Michael Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
5955 Dwight Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
5956 Jim No. We're not.
5957 Dwight Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
5958 Jim Which means absolutely nothing.
5959 Dwight Michael, can you explain?

5963 Jim Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
5964 Dwight I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
5965 Jim Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
5966 Dwight Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
5967 Jim You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
5968 Dwight You did?
5969 Jim Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
5970 Dwight Yes. I am.
5971 Jim The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
5972 Dwight Which is?

5975 Jim Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind.
5976 Dwight I'll glance at it.
5977 Michael It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
5978 Angela The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
5979 Dwight Thank you, Angela.

5992 Speaker Dwight, how we doing?
5993 Dwight No, I can't... I ca...

6007 Michael Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
6008 Dwight [bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
6009 Crowd [clapping]
6010 Dwight WE ARE WARRIORS!
6011 Crowd [clapping and cheering]
6012 Dwight Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
6013 Crowd [clapping and cheering]
6014 Dwight [laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes!

6020 Ryan Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
6021 Dwight No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
6022 Crowd [claps]
6023 Dwight Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...

6036 Jim Alright.
6037 Dwight Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
6038 Michael I got thirsty. How'd it go?
6039 Dwight It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
6040 Michael You would not believe what happened here.
6041 Dwight What? Something happened?
6042 Michael Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
6043 Dwight Weird.
6044 Michael Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
6045 Dwight Con artist.

6081 Michael and Dwight [singing] ...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you...
6082 Dwight [looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one.
6083 Dwight And they do, your parents, love you very much.
6084 Toby [to Sasha] Come on.
6085 Michael One more time. [singing] You...
6086 Dwight You are the future!
6087 Dwight The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.

6137 Jim [shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
6138 Dwight There is no way that hurt.
6139 Jim Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.
6140 Dwight Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
6141 Jake Do you have any computer games?
6142 Dwight No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
6143 Jake Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here.
6144 Dwight You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
6145 Jake Whatever, okay?
6146 Dwight You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
6147 Jake That's your name? Mister Poop?
6148 Dwight Schrute. Mister Schrute.
6149 Jake Sure, Mister Poop. [Jake walks away]
6150 Dwight [quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]

6168 Ryan Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
6169 Dwight [plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
6170 Michael Dwight! Dwight!
6171 Dwight There's a photo...
6172 Michael What the hell are you reading to them?
6173 Dwight These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---

6176 Michael What's a Nazi?
6177 Dwight [standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement...
6178 Michael Don't!
6179 Dwight ...from the 1930's...
6180 Michael Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
6181 Dwight I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
6182 Michael [sighing] Why don't you just leave? Okay?
6183 Dwight ...Okay.

6197 Michael You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
6198 Dwight We have better service than they do!

6229 Michael That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
6230 Dwight Is that a real fun shooting windmill?

6242 Chet I want to be on TV!
6243 Dwight [employees chuckle] And he is on TV now!

6275 Jake Mister Poop, I have to tell you something.
6276 Dwight Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
6277 Jake You're ugly.
6278 Dwight Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...

6337 Michael [Dwight knocks on door] Yeah.
6338 Dwight Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
6339 Michael Ohh, god.
6340 Dwight Birthday hug!
6341 Michael No no no, no, new suit, please.
6342 Dwight That suit is amazing.
6343 Michael Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
6344 Dwight Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
6345 Michael Good luck. One of a kind.
6346 Dwight Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
6347 Michael Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
6348 Dwight Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
6349 Michael Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
6350 Dwight Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']

6354 Angela One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
6355 Dwight Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
6356 Phyllis Where do we get those?
6357 Dwight Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
6358 Pam Michael wants a strippergram?
6359 Dwight Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.

6405 Michael [eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that?
6406 Dwight It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
6407 Michael Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
6408 Dwight I probably care more than she does.

6413 Pam If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
6414 Dwight Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here!
6415 Michael What?
6416 Dwight Listen up everyone! It is 11
6417 Michael [grinning] Ohhh, God.
6418 Dwight There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
6419 Michael Ohhh, no.
6420 Dwight So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
6421 Oscar ...I'll do it.
6422 Michael Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
6423 Dwight Creed! Come on. Stanley!
6424 Pam ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
6425 Jim Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
6426 Dwight On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
6427 Michael Okay.
6428 Dwight Happy birth moment, Michael.
6429 Michael Thank you.
6430 Dwight One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
6431 Michael Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
6432 Dwight Oscar...
6433 Oscar It wasn't me.
6434 Dwight Okay, that is not an eight foot sub.
6435 Delivery Boy Uh, we don't make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs.
6436 Dwight F. Alright, what's the damage?
6437 Delivery Boy Uh, thirty-nine sixty.
6438 Dwight [pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty.
6439 Dwight Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
6440 Dwight Here they come.
6441 Michael Get in here... everybody.
6442 Dwight Come and get it!
6443 Michael Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
6444 Oscar What is this?
6445 Dwight Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.

6459 Pam And his favorite lunch.
6460 Dwight Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
6461 Ryan [making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
6462 Dwight Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
6463 Angela [grabs cake] Oh. Thank you.
6464 Dwight Oh. I got it.
6465 Angela What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
6466 Dwight [whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
6467 Angela Fine.
6468 Dwight What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
6469 Angela Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.
6470 Dwight [whispering] But what if i'm hungry?

6481 Michael Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
6482 Dwight Here we go. Make a wish.
6483 Michael Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles]
6484 Dwight Yaoo yay! [claps]
6485 Michael ... I asked for trick candles.
6486 Dwight Pam was supposed to get 'em.

6512 Michael Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
6513 Dwight Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
6514 Jim Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
6515 Dwight Please, don't.

6520 Michael [sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.
6521 Dwight I'll get someone to take it down.

6527 Jim Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
6528 Dwight YEAH!

6554 Michael Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
6555 Dwight Turn it around. Turn it around.
6556 Michael Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
6557 Dwight Number one!!
6558 Michael Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
6559 Pam Michael?
6560 Dwight Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
6561 Jim You look cute today, Dwight.
6562 Dwight Thanks, girl.
6563 Jim So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs.
6564 Dwight Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like
6565 Kevin [nods] Hey...
6566 Dwight I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.

6569 Kelly And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said "Is it okay if I sip it?" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
6570 Dwight Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night?
6571 Kelly Six.
6572 Dwight I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
6573 Ryan I go to a lot of parties.
6574 Dwight Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys.
6575 Ryan I am not giving you my keys.
6576 Dwight Don't make me do this the hard way.
6577 Ryan What's the hard way?
6578 Dwight I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
6579 Ryan Yeah, let's do it that way.
6580 Michael Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
6581 Dwight I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
6582 Jim Whoa. You are a volunteer.
6583 Dwight I volunteered for this job.
6584 Jim And that's not the same.
6585 Dwight It is my duty...
6586 Jim [interrupting] Volunteer duty.
6587 Dwight ...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
6588 Michael [fake coughing] Narc!
6589 Kevin [giggling]
6590 Dwight If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
6591 Michael I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
6592 Dwight Well, you have...
6593 Michael Uuf, well...
6594 Dwight ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
6595 Michael [shakes head] Okay...
6596 Dwight ...and I am very proud of being a narc.

6600 Ryan I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
6601 Dwight Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
6602 Dwight Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
6603 Oscar No, I have not.
6604 Dwight Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
6605 Oscar What are you implying?
6606 Dwight Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
6607 Oscar Okay. I'm done with this.
6608 Dwight He sure left in a hurry.
6609 Dwight I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
6610 Dwight Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
6611 Phyllis Yes, it's marijuana.
6612 Dwight How do you know that?
6613 Phyllis It's labeled.
6614 Dwight [grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
6615 Creed That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
6616 Dwight No, it's marijuana.
6617 Jim I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
6618 Dwight That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.
6619 Jim Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
6620 Dwight I would remember.
6621 Jim Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
6622 Dwight That's not how it works.
6623 Jim Now how do you know how it works?
6624 Dwight Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.
6625 Jim No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
6626 Dwight [opens eyes wide in total surprise]

6641 Jim [presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
6642 Dwight I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
6643 Angela I understand.
6644 Dwight Where were you yesterday after work?

6648 Michael Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?
6649 Dwight Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
6650 Michael Waa... what? What are you talking about?
6651 Dwight Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.

6655 Michael Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
6656 Dwight No you can't do that.
6657 Michael I can do that, it is my office.
6658 Dwight No you cannot. It has to be official, and it has to be urine.
6659 Michael Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.
6660 Dwight Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
6661 Kevin I'm not taking Rogaine.
6662 Dwight Angela, what about you?
6663 Angela I don't take any prescription drugs.
6664 Dwight You're not on anything?
6665 Angela [Gives Dwight a knowing look]
6666 Dwight Good.

6676 Michael No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."
6677 Dwight Thank you, Michael.

6699 Michael The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
6700 Dwight No, you will be tested.
6701 Michael Yes, I will not be.
6702 Dwight You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
6703 Michael Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
6704 Dwight Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
6705 Linda We test a lot of urine.
6706 Dwight Mine was green.
6707 Linda Oh, right. How are you?
6708 Dwight I'm all better.
6709 Michael So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
6710 Dwight What kind of filing?
6711 Michael Just forget it. Just the urine.
6712 Dwight That goes directly to the tester.
6713 Michael Just. I need your urine.
6714 Dwight Like in a cup?
6715 Michael Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
6716 Dwight For what purpose?
6717 Michael It's none of your business.
6718 Dwight Then I refuse.
6719 Michael Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
6720 Dwight Are you serious?
6721 Michael I need clean urine for the lady.
6722 Dwight But that's illegal.
6723 Michael Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
6724 Dwight Not my urine.
6725 Michael A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
6726 Dwight Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
6727 Michael No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
6728 Angela Do you want to give Michael your urine?
6729 Dwight I want him to have all the urine he needs.
6730 Angela You're not going to get my permission on this.
6731 Dwight I know that. Don't you think I know that?

6735 Ryan Yeah. Maybe.
6736 Dwight My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.

6741 Michael Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
6742 Dwight That's great.
6743 Michael What's wrong? Where's your costume?
6744 Dwight It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
6745 Michael Why? Wha...
6746 Dwight I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.

6752 Michael Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
6753 Dwight Really?
6754 Michael Yes, sir.
6755 Dwight That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .

6759 Hank Here's your badge.
6760 Dwight Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank] Can I have a gun?
6761 Hank No, I don't have a gun.
6762 Dwight Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
6763 Hank I don't think so.
6764 Michael Good.
6765 Dwight [salutes] Thank you, Michael.
6766 Michael No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes]
6767 Dwight I need to go over some details with you.
6768 Michael Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.
6769 Dwight First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
6770 Hank Two.
6771 Dwight Oh, God.

6800 Phyllis Okay... [removes glasses]
6801 Dwight Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
6802 Phyllis [leaving the room] Excuse me.
6803 Dwight Clown paint.
6804 Dwight I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?

6876 Photographer Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest]
6877 Dwight Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.

6887 Michael Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
6888 Dwight Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?

6903 Jim And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
6904 Dwight That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
6905 Jim Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
6906 Dwight Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?

6940 Jim Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
6941 Dwight That doesn't make any sense.
6942 Jim Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
6943 Photographer [to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile.
6944 Dwight No.
6945 Dwight I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
6946 Jim This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
6947 Dwight This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
6948 Jim Oh.
6949 Dwight And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
6950 Jim What did I write?
6951 Dwight I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
6952 Toby Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
6953 Dwight What box?!

6956 Michael Uh. Dwight.
6957 Dwight Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
6958 Michael Okay! Calm down.
6959 Dwight No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
6960 Michael Hey, hey!
6961 Dwight Him or me?
6962 Michael Stop.
6963 Dwight Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
6964 Michael Okay...
6965 Dwight Either he goes, or I go.
6966 Michael Dwight...
6967 Dwight You choose!
6968 Michael Stop...
6969 Dwight One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
6970 Michael Oh... kay...
6971 Dwight I am not bluffing!
6972 Michael Okay.
6973 Dwight Okay?
6974 Michael Yes.
6975 Dwight Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
6976 Michael Mm-hmm.
6977 Dwight I deserve this. You know I do!
6978 Michael [picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
6979 Dwight You have till five.
6980 Dwight Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!

6992 Jim Maybe Stanford would be cool.
6993 Dwight It's a good market. Higher volume.
6994 Jim Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
6995 Dwight I have a girlfriend...
6996 Jim Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
6997 Michael Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
6998 Dwight So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
6999 Michael Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
7000 Dwight I want an answer by tomorrow.
7001 Michael Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
7002 Dwight Fine.

7012 Michael Come on, everybody.
7013 Dwight Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.

7032 Jim Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
7033 Dwight Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
7034 Dwight I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.

7037 Oscar Let it ride. Let it all ride.
7038 Dwight I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
7039 Dwight Give me the dice!

7043 Pam "Yeah, right," what?
7044 Dwight Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.

7047 Pam [Laughs] I have good cards.
7048 Dwight Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.

7051 Pam Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.
7052 Dwight How would you do that?

7055 Kevin Yeah, I think she's full of it.
7056 Dwight [laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?

7059 Jim Oh. Three nines.
7060 Dwight I don't believe you. Continue.

7063 Jim Thank you very much. It was fun.
7064 Dwight [scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.

7067 Carol Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.
7068 Dwight Oh, my God.

7086 Michael Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
7087 Dwight Come on, shooter!

7098 Michael You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
7099 Dwight Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?

7102 Michael Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
7103 Dwight Super 8?

7106 Oscar Again? We do that every year.
7107 Dwight Motel 6? Best Western?

7110 Oscar It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
7111 Dwight Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
7112 Michael Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
7113 Kevin I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
7114 Dwight Yes!

7124 Michael Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
7125 Dwight Nice, very nice.

7130 Kevin Something with animals. Or people.
7131 Dwight Oh, man!

7157 Roy Sweet. All right.
7158 Dwight Wait, canine AIDS?

7201 Jim Okay, will do.
7202 Dwight Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.

7205 Pam Bye! Hey.
7206 Dwight When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.

7337 Michael Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks]
7338 Dwight Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
7339 Dwight I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, "We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them."

7367 Toby I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
7368 Dwight I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.

7385 Michael Um...
7386 Dwight Hey, hey.
7387 Michael Hey. What...
7388 Dwight Jan's here.
7389 Dwight Give me the dice.
7390 Kevin Come on, Dwight.
7391 Dwight Let's go.
7392 Billy It's all on you, baby. Let's go.
7393 Angela Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
7394 Dwight Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
7395 Kevin Yes.
7396 Angela Then roll an eight.
7397 Dwight Thank you, Angela.

7403 Jim Are you really gonna marry him? [Pam nods] ...Ok.
7404 Dwight [sobbing] Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! [serious] False. I do not miss him.

7437 Michael Can you tell who's gay and who's not?
7438 Dwight Of course.
7439 Michael What about Oscar?
7440 Dwight Absolutely not.
7441 Michael Well, he is.
7442 Dwight Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
7443 Michael [deep sigh] There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.
7444 Dwight You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
7445 Michael Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
7446 Michael Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman.
7447 Dwight I really don't think so.
7448 Michael I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
7449 Dwight [creepy smile]
7450 Michael Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.
7451 Dwight Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
7452 Michael That's ridiculous.
7453 Dwight Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.
7454 Michael [sighs] Let's call him and get the website.
7455 Dwight Definitely.
7456 Jim What's gay-dar? Oh, oh, gay-dar, yes! No, uh, I think they have it at Sharper Image. Oh, you know what? I could check for you. No problem. [loudly fake typing] It's sold out! Yeah sorry about that, that's a bummer.
7457 Michael Well, they're sold out.
7458 Dwight Damn. [thinks] I'll try Brookstone.

7491 Pam Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.
7492 Dwight Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons.
7493 Michael [looking at gay p0rn] Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p0rn, straight p0rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful.
7494 Dwight Ah damn pop-ups.

7505 Kevin [/b]
7506 Dwight I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
7507 Oscar No one else in this office is gay.
7508 Dwight What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!

7528 Michael [sobbing] I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.
7529 Dwight Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend.

7535 Oscar I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.
7536 Dwight [reading the note with the gay-dar] "Hope this helps. -Jim" Nice!
7537 Oscar [Dwight is running the gay-dar over Oscar's body] What are you doing?!
7538 Dwight Shhh. Don't be scared. [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works. [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle] ...oh no.

7606 Michael I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
7607 Dwight Don't be mad, it is a business trip.

7610 Michael Yeah.
7611 Dwight Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.

7614 Michael I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.
7615 Dwight Yes, Monkey.

7638 Michael Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular." But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.
7639 Dwight And your veil.
7640 Michael Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha.
7641 Michael Yeah, do it!
7642 Dwight Ha, ha, ha, ha.

7645 Michael Really? Okay. Well, word of advice[/b]
7646 Dwight Blood, urine, or semen.

7649 Michael Um. Okay, um.
7650 Dwight Um.
7651 Michael You got that?
7652 Dwight I got it.
7653 Michael Write it down.
7654 Dwight I got it.
7655 Dwight Um.

7662 Creed Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. [introducing himself] Creed.
7663 Dwight Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?

7670 Michael Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
7671 Dwight Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
7672 Jim Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
7673 Michael Hey!
7674 Dwight Shut up. That's impossible.
7675 Jim No, it's not. I did. Yep.
7676 Dwight Well, I did it too.

7682 Kevin If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.
7683 Dwight So what kind of commissions you get up there?
7684 Jim Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.
7685 Dwight You're so immature!

7689 Jan Oh, hey!
7690 Dwight Hey, Jan.

7703 Kelly And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.
7704 Dwight This party is going to be awesome.
7705 Michael I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
7706 Dwight Check it out.
7707 Michael That is crooked on that side.
7708 Dwight Wow.

7721 Michael All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
7722 Dwight I'll do a shot, Michael.

7725 Michael Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.
7726 Dwight Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
7727 Jerome Bettis All right.
7728 Dwight I'm a huge fan.

7734 Michael So maybe. See ya.
7735 Dwight Why do they call him The Bus?
7736 Michael Because he's afraid to fly.
7737 Dwight Smile!

7740 Michael Yep. Yeah, she's up front.
7741 Dwight You don't have email on your phone.
7742 Michael I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
7743 Dwight No one just called you.

7749 Michael I need you to do something for me.
7750 Dwight Yes. Anything.
7751 Michael I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
7752 Dwight I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.

7759 Toby Okay.
7760 Dwight So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
7761 Michael And?
7762 Dwight He wasn't volunteering today.

7775 Michael Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.
7776 Dwight Whoa. Michael.
7777 Waiter Wow, oh my God, thank you.
7778 Michael You're welcome.
7779 Dwight Was that your per diem?

7792 Jim Michael.
7793 Dwight Hey, Michael.

7800 Michael Okay! Excellent. Oh...
7801 Dwight Keep the wing flaps.

7805 Michael You first.
7806 Dwight Come on. Nice try, Josh!

7825 Michael Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
7826 Dwight Yes! Ha!

7840 Michael Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!
7841 Dwight [Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me. Please.
7842 Michael Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!
7843 Michael Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
7844 Dwight [directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there. Second from the end.
7845 Dwight [terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!

7848 Pam [walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?
7849 Dwight [sobbing] I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year!

7852 Pam [with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else? Nooo.
7853 Dwight I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]

7856 Michael Entourage!
7857 Dwight You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do? [Michael exhales] What can I do? [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do? What can I do?

7861 Michael Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate.
7862 Dwight Why him?

7869 Jan [walking into an empty office because everyone is watching Varsity Blues] Hello?
7870 Dwight Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who.

7880 Angela Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.
7881 Dwight That's not going to happen.
7882 Angela You know she has it out for him now.
7883 Dwight That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!
7884 Dwight Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms.
7885 Angela Dwight, you should be running this office.
7886 Dwight Michael would never let me...
7887 Angela It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.
7888 Dwight I could never do that!

7906 Karen [laughing] Yeah.
7907 Dwight [outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH! GAH! [breathing heavily]
7908 Jan [answering the phone] Hello?
7909 Dwight Is this Jan?
7910 Jan Who is this?
7911 Dwight This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
7912 Jan You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.
7913 Dwight It's about Michael.
7914 Jan What about him?
7915 Dwight [exhales] I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.
7916 Jan It's not about a surprise party is it?
7917 Dwight No, but we should discuss that another time.
7918 Jan Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.
7919 Dwight Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
7920 Jan How do you know I like that store?
7921 Dwight Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
7922 Jan How do you know that?
7923 Dwight Part of my job.
7924 Jan No it's not. It's officially not.
7925 Dwight ...noted.
7926 Dwight [walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.
7927 Michael Ok.
7928 Dwight I have to have an emergency crown put in.
7929 Michael Ouchy.
7930 Dwight Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours.
7931 Michael Three hours, wow. Have fun. [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]
7932 Dwight Did you get anything good?
7933 Jan Yeah.
7934 Dwight New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy?
7935 Dwight I can save the branch.
7936 Jan Really?
7937 Dwight If you let me run it.
7938 Jan Ok.
7939 Dwight [excitedly] "Ok" I can run it?
7940 Jan What would you do differently?
7941 Dwight Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house. [to waitress in diner] Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.
7942 Jan Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.
7943 Dwight The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So [cutting his food, giving Jan a "so there" look], here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision.
7944 Dwight [shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way. There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here. I know you like their earrings.

7990 Michael Hey Dwight.
7991 Dwight Hey.
7992 Michael Do you want an M&M?
7993 Dwight No thanks I'm stuffed.
7994 Michael No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good.
7995 Dwight ...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's]
7996 Michael They're good, huh?
7997 Dwight ...so good.
7998 Michael Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
7999 Dwight They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
8000 Michael Sounds like a good dentist.
8001 Dwight Oh, yeah.
8002 Michael What's his name?
8003 Dwight [long pause] Crentist.
8004 Michael Your dentist's name is Crentist.
8005 Dwight Yep.
8006 Michael Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.
8007 Dwight Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
8008 Michael Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em.
8009 Dwight [reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside] Ahh. Aaaah.
8010 Michael You should... floss.
8011 Dwight I know...

8015 Michael [in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough.
8016 Dwight What?
8017 Michael Ohhhh. Arrrgggh!
8018 Dwight What is it?
8019 Michael Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me.
8020 Dwight No.
8021 Michael Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
8022 Dwight Gahh!
8023 Michael And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
8024 Dwight I can't believe this news. That--- wow.
8025 Michael I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.
8026 Dwight You said that?
8027 Michael Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it.
8028 Dwight Well... Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will.
8029 Michael [exhales] Perfect, well, we're settled.
8030 Dwight All right.
8031 Michael All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
8032 Dwight Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it.
8033 Michael Ohh..
8034 Dwight Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
8035 Michael [muttering] Can't you? That's so nice.
8036 Michael Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.
8037 Dwight Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.

8041 Angela Congratulations Dwight.
8042 Dwight Thank you Angela.

8047 Michael Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?
8048 Dwight Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity!

8057 Angela It's really happening!
8058 Dwight Yes.
8059 Angela We can make a difference here.
8060 Dwight I, will, make a difference here.
8061 Angela You alone? Because I thought together we could---
8062 Dwight Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women.

8077 Michael Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.
8078 Dwight [smiling] No thank you.
8079 Michael It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
8080 Dwight No thanks.
8081 Michael What?
8082 Dwight Not my style.
8083 Michael But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.
8084 Dwight Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
8085 Michael [Michael finally breaks] Take it back.
8086 Dwight [confused] No.
8087 Michael That's my car.
8088 Dwight What did you---
8089 Michael THAT'S MY CAR.
8090 Dwight Yes.
8091 Michael I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know.
8092 Dwight You know what?
8093 Michael Jan called me about your little meeting!
8094 Dwight No!
8095 Michael I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
8096 Dwight I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD.

8101 Michael All right, I'll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs]
8102 Dwight [laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!
8103 Michael [hands Ryan pencil] There you go.
8104 Dwight Awesome!
8105 Ryan Thank you.
8106 Michael You're welcome.
8107 Dwight Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
8108 Michael Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute. [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk]
8109 Dwight Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo!

8155 Michael What?
8156 Dwight Really?
8157 Creed He was drunk as a skunk, he was flying down Route 6. He slides under an 18 wheeler. Pop. It snaps right off.
8158 Michael Oh my God.
8159 Dwight That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.
8160 Creed You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.
8161 Dwight You're thinking of a chicken.

8164 Michael [clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...
8165 Dwight Ed was decapitated.
8166 Michael What are you doing?
8167 Dwight You said you didn't know how to say it.
8168 Michael I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
8169 Dwight Hey.
8170 Angela Hi.
8171 Dwight If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
8172 Angela I do not wanna talk about this.
8173 Dwight When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.

8184 Michael We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...
8185 Dwight That is not a statue, that is a robot.
8186 Michael I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
8187 Dwight And how big do you want this robot?
8188 Michael Life-size.
8189 Dwight Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us.

8199 Michael DEAD.
8200 Dwight Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.

8239 Michael Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
8240 Dwight [grabbing ball] I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.

8264 Michael Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]
8265 Dwight Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael. Michael ...
8266 Michael [seeing bird] Oh, God!
8267 Dwight [in disgust] Oh...
8268 Michael Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ...
8269 Dwight Poor little fella.
8270 Michael Oh shhhh--oot!
8271 Dwight He is a goner.
8272 Michael No, he's not.
8273 Dwight Yeah.
8274 Michael No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face]
8275 Dwight Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!

8279 Kelly Ugh, no that thing is dead.
8280 Dwight You want me to flush him?

8293 Kelly I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan [Michael walks away disgusted] for him to know that we have a date tonight?
8294 Dwight [trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!
8295 Michael What are... What are you doing?
8296 Dwight What? No, this is about the right size.
8297 Michael No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?
8298 Dwight I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
8299 Dwight I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining.
8300 Pam Is it for the bird?
8301 Dwight Yeah.
8302 Pam I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box]
8303 Dwight Oh, thank you.
8304 Pam If you wanna do something for the funeral...
8305 Dwight Yes, please.
8306 Pam Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.
8307 Dwight Excellent.
8308 Pam Do you have it with you?
8309 Dwight Always. [runs off]

8324 Pam And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.
8325 Dwight He's not a songbird.

8328 Angela [quickly] Amen.
8329 Dwight [begins playing recorder]
8330 Pam [singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin. You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...
8331 Michael Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.
8332 Dwight Let's get back to work.
8333 Dwight Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?

8336 Jim Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?
8337 Dwight No, I said one of them is not a nickel.

8340 Jim Pam?
8341 Dwight Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...

8344 Jim Pam?
8345 Dwight A man is found hanging from the ceiling...

8348 Jim Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.
8349 Dwight A hunter.

8352 Jim Oh, no no.
8353 Dwight Damn it!

8376 Pam It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.
8377 Dwight So you excited?
8378 Ryan Yeah.
8379 Dwight Very excited?
8380 Ryan Yes. I'm very excited.
8381 Dwight Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool.
8382 Ryan I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.
8383 Dwight I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
8384 Ryan So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? [car stops] So where's the sales office?
8385 Dwight When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.

8394 Michael Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.
8395 Dwight Do you know where we are, temp?
8396 Ryan I know where we're not.
8397 Dwight I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.

8408 Michael [looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on.
8409 Dwight And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
8410 Ryan I don't think you know what you're saying.
8411 Dwight Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?
8412 Ryan Uh huh.
8413 Dwight It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
8414 Ryan Gotcha.
8415 Dwight Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back.

8432 Ryan Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.
8433 Dwight Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.

8450 Michael Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.
8451 Dwight It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
8452 Ryan Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.
8453 Dwight You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
8454 Ryan Yeah.
8455 Dwight Come on!

8463 Michael All right! Thank you!
8464 Dwight Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight]
8465 Ryan Who was that?
8466 Dwight Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
8467 Ryan Is that your Cousin Mose?
8468 Dwight Yes.
8469 Dwight Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
8470 Dwight What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
8471 Ryan Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.
8472 Dwight Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
8473 Ryan Depression?
8474 Dwight Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?

8482 Angela You're a freak!
8483 Dwight Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
8484 Ryan Um, loneliness. Maybe women.
8485 Dwight Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
8486 Ryan No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK.
8487 Dwight Wrestle him to the ground.
8488 Ryan No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.
8489 Dwight Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
8490 Cousin Mose Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice.
8491 Dwight Where are all the animals?
8492 Dwight Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
8493 Dwight You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
8494 Ryan Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.
8495 Dwight Screwgun. The sales call!
8496 Kevin [Michael is listening to "Rock And Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter" and everyone can hear it. Kevin singing in unison with the song] Hey! Hey!
8497 Michael Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
8498 Dwight Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
8499 Ryan Wait, can you go back?
8500 Dwight Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
8501 Ryan Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.
8502 Dwight Good.
8503 Ryan I'm going to put everything in terms of "real dollars".
8504 Dwight Right.
8505 Ryan I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.
8506 Dwight Uh huh.
8507 Ryan Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.
8508 Dwight Exactly. Yes.

8518 Ryan They really didn't like me.
8519 Dwight They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
8520 Ryan I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.
8521 Dwight Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
8522 Ryan You drive.
8523 Pam Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.
8524 Dwight [Dwight chokes as Ryan downs a beer in one drink] Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.

8610 Pam I just feel kind of tired, you know.
8611 Dwight Maybe you've got mono.
8612 Pam Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.
8613 Kelly Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?
8614 Dwight Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.

8633 Kevin She looks like Pam from the neck down.
8634 Dwight Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...

8640 Michael Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '
8641 Dwight I see dead people.
8642 Michael Okay. Spoiler... alert.
8643 Dwight He was dead the whole time.

8703 Pam I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?
8704 Dwight Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!

8808 Karen Hey.
8809 Dwight [on the phone] Oh my God!

8812 Karen Who are you faxing so early in the morning?
8813 Dwight nan

8816 Jim I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight."
8817 Dwight We did it!
8818 Dwight No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.

8826 Jan Michael.
8827 Dwight In your face!

8830 Jan Michael.
8831 Dwight Oh, man.

8834 Jan I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.
8835 Dwight I don't ... have no idea.

8856 Michael Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.
8857 Dwight Hey stranger.
8858 Michael Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
8859 Dwight Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.

8905 Michael All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at Dwight] Let's go.
8906 Dwight Yes!
8907 Pam Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.
8908 Michael Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
8909 Dwight What's the plan?
8910 Michael Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.
8911 Dwight Can I drive?
8912 Michael No... way.
8913 Dwight Shotgun!
8914 Michael No. There's no one else.
8915 Dwight Still.
8916 Dwight Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
8917 Michael Okay, okay. Um...
8918 Dwight But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.
8919 Michael Why?
8920 Dwight Christmas card list.
8921 Michael You sent him cards? You never met him.
8922 Dwight But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.

8949 Jim Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
8950 Dwight So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
8951 Michael I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
8952 Dwight No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
8953 Michael All right.
8954 Dwight [as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
8955 M ichael Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?
8956 Dwight Yes? What is the meaning of this?
8957 Michael  Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
8958 Dwight Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
8959 Michael Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
8960 Dwight Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity
8961 Michael [no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
8962 Dwight [as himself] Whoa hey, why not?
8963 Michael Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
8964 Dwight Okay.
8965 Michael Don't touch me this time.
8966 Dwight [as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
8967 Michael Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
8968 Dwight [frightened] Uh!

8990 Angela No.
8991 Dwight Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.

9006 Jan Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.
9007 Dwight [referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?
9008 Michael The office.
9009 Dwight Gonna get it?

9029 Michael Anything?
9030 Dwight Nothing. [puts down binoculars]
9031 Michael What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
9032 Dwight Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
9033 Michael [pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
9034 Dwight My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
9035 Michael That was hilarious. The foam ...
9036 Dwight Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
9037 Michael Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.
9038 Dwight What were your favorite moments?
9039 Michael Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
9040 Dwight What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
9041 Michael God, Dwight!
9042 Dwight Well, it doesn't...

9065 Michael What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.
9066 Dwight [picks up his beeping cell phone]

9070 Andy [to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out... [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.
9071 Dwight Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.

9099 Pam Oh. You've changed so much.
9100 Dwight Psh, why is that great?

9103 Pam So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?
9104 Dwight What was your mile time?

9107 Pam Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.
9108 Dwight [scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.

9111 Michael Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
9112 Dwight Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.

9115 Michael All right.
9116 Dwight Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.

9119 Michael Okay.
9120 Dwight I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
9121 Jim All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.
9122 Dwight Man, what is taking Toby so long?

9125 Jim All right!
9126 Dwight And you'll compare the times?

9129 Hannah [using breast pump] Take a picture. It'll last longer.
9130 Dwight No, my groin...

9133 Creed Ditto that, my brother.
9134 Dwight ...is really tight.

9137 Michael What is that? A squid's eye or...
9138 Dwight I can't... [starts running]

9141 Michael How did you...
9142 Dwight Aaaaah!

9147 Phyllis What smell?
9148 Dwight Nametag?

9151 Phyllis Oh, I'll help you find it.
9152 Dwight Karen Filippelli.

9155 Phyllis What is it?
9156 Dwight Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.

9163 Phyllis Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.
9164 Dwight That's Andy Bernard.

9167 Phyllis You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.
9168 Dwight If I were you...

9171 Michael People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.
9172 Dwight ...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
9173 Michael I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.
9174 Michael What?
9175 Dwight Do you have batteries?
9176 Dwight ...before noon...

9179 Andy [sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?']
9180 Dwight ...to consolidate power.

9183 Andy [sings] What is love?
9184 Dwight No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
9185 Michael Yes, yes! Okay!
9186 Dwight The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.

9199 Andy Whoa-oh-oh-oh
9200 Dwight Hannah Smoterich-Barr.

9214 Kevin Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.
9215 Dwight Very funny, Michael!

9218 Hannah My bag's mostly pencils.
9219 Dwight Really funny, Michael!

9244 Karen Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?
9245 Dwight Do this. Come on. Ready?

9248 Andy I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.
9249 Dwight On three. One... two... three.

9280 Michael Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is...
9281 Dwight Hey, hey. Easy.

9297 Tony I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit.
9298 Dwight Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.

9301 Tony I can't work here. I have to quit.
9302 Dwight Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.

9305 Tony No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.
9306 Dwight What are you doing?

9309 Tony No. Was it supposed to be funny?
9310 Dwight I have a smudge on my forehead?

9313 Tony Excuse me?
9314 Dwight Why are you looking at my forehead?

9317 Tony But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.
9318 Dwight Meet my eye line, Jim!
9319 Michael Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
9320 Jim I am.
9321 Dwight That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
9322 Dwight Stop acting like an idiot!
9323 Michael Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
9324 Jim Okay.
9325 Dwight And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.

9342 Ryan Cool, thank you.
9343 Dwight What!

9352 Toby Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says
9353 Dwight YEAH!

9361 Martin Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?
9362 Dwight Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.

9365 Hannah For crying out loud.
9366 Dwight So you'll be reporting to me, then.

9369 Martin [to Stanley] What's up with this guy?
9370 Dwight My title has 'Manager' in it.

9373 Michael THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
9374 Dwight Oh.

9377 Martin Is he always like this?
9378 Dwight I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.

9418 Kevin This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! [whispers] Shoot.
9419 Dwight If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
9420 Michael [talking to himself] I present the orientation video.
9421 Jim Yeah, it does, actually.
9422 Dwight We need to talk!
9423 Dwight So who will be your new Number Three?
9424 Michael Not now.
9425 Michael Uh... that I have not decided yet.
9426 Dwight Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?

9429 Michael Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.
9430 Dwight Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
9431 Dwight And I have to say your leadership...
9432 Michael It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
9433 Michael Shut it...
9434 Dwight Ok. Who reports to who?
9435 Dwight has brought...
9436 Michael I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
9437 Michael Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up!
9438 Dwight And then if I want...

9441 Karen [off camera] I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.
9442 Dwight I...

9445 Karen Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.
9446 Dwight I...

9449 Karen Yeah.
9450 Dwight One...

9490 Toby Um... You might want these orientation materials.
9491 Dwight Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.

9494 Jim Oh, this looks promising.
9495 Dwight Xterra's not even a real word.

9498 Michael Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".
9499 Dwight Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?

9502 Michael Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
9503 Dwight That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
9504 Dwight Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
9505 Andy Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.
9506 Michael So check out how we live
9507 Dwight Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.

9510 Michael They call it Scranton.
9511 Dwight Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
9512 Dwight What?
9513 Andy Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.
9514 Michael The Electric City. Scranton.
9515 Dwight Idiot!
9516 Dwight What?
9517 Andy If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.
9518 Michael The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
9519 Dwight If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
9520 Dwight But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
9521 Andy [coughs word] Idiot!
9522 Jim It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.
9523 Dwight [coughs sentence] You're the idiot!

9526 Video [Lazy Scranton video continues]
9527 Dwight [coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.
9528 Michael You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
9529 Dwight But the little cars go in the compact spot

9607 Michael Just... try to be cool.
9608 Dwight I am cool.
9609 Michael Okay, are you cool, really?
9610 Dwight I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
9611 Michael Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
9612 Dwight I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.

9711 Michael Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
9712 Dwight Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?

9732 Andy [singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...
9733 Dwight Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk]
9734 Pam Merry Christ--[looks up] NO! Why... why did you bring that here?
9735 Dwight It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face]
9736 Dwight Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.

9739 Andy No.
9740 Dwight I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
9741 Dwight Who are you calling?
9742 Pam Well, get it out of here.
9743 Michael I'm just gonna call her.
9744 Dwight Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?

9747 Waitress What can I get for 'ya?
9748 Dwight Jim.

9751 Andy One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.
9752 Dwight What does it look like?

9755 Pam That's a great idea.
9756 Dwight And circle gets the square.

9759 Phyllis I was just getting a snack.
9760 Dwight [to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.

9763 Angela Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.
9764 Dwight No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
9765 Phyllis OK.
9766 Dwight Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
9767 Kevin I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.
9768 Dwight He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.

9771 Roy So I only use three?
9772 Dwight Exactly. Thank you, Jim.

9779 Roy OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?
9780 Dwight Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.

9783 Roy [Karen walks in] Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later. [leaves room]
9784 Dwight It's Christmas Toby.

9787 Karen He's cute. You should date him.
9788 Dwight Toby...
9789 Pam Oh, yeah... Maybe.
9790 Toby I'm sorry.
9791 Dwight Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
9792 Dwight [sighs] Please? Please?
9793 Chef No, it's Usuba.
9794 Toby Clean it in your car.
9795 Dwight Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
9796 Pam I would like it off my desk.
9797 Chef Actually, the Usuba's the better knife when you're working with this quantity.
9798 Dwight Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
9799 Dwight Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.

9820 Michael No.
9821 Dwight Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]

9828 Michael Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
9829 Dwight [with conviction] Start the party.

9867 Angela I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.
9868 Dwight [standing up] Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.

9886 Michael Right.
9887 Dwight Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?

9890 Michael Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
9891 Dwight Oh... Narcolepsy.

9898 Michael I don't understand?
9899 Dwight Oh my gosh, now she's up.

9902 Carol I think you're a really sweet guy.
9903 Dwight Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.

9973 Second Cindy That rocks.
9974 Dwight [over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?

10001 Michael Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
10002 Dwight Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
10003 Dwight Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!
10004 Michael Take it from Toby.
10005 Michael We're going to ...
10006 Dwight Copy.

10024 Angela It would never work here.
10025 Dwight No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party]

10030 Karen A Christmas drinking game ...
10031 Dwight No... way! Yeah!

10034 Angela God help you.
10035 Dwight Oh.

10038 Angela These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas." I think you should leave.
10039 Dwight Walkie-talkies.

10042 Angela You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. [Angela gets up from seat] Please. [Karen gets up and leaves] Thank you. OK, thank you very much. [Angela closes door]
10043 Dwight Yes!
10044 Michael What are you doing? ["Goodbye My Lover" by James Blunt plays]
10045 Karen Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.
10046 Dwight [putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.

10051 Angela I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?
10052 Dwight Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to "Goodbye My Lover" on computer]
10053 Pam Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.
10054 Dwight Why don't you just buy the whole song?

10057 Pam Mmm. Hmm.
10058 Dwight Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.

10106 Angela Two hundred dollars.
10107 Dwight [into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?

10133 Second Cindy I... We're just gonna take off.
10134 Dwight Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.

10137 Second Cindy No... I have school. [leaves with other waitress and bicycle]
10138 Dwight As ranking number three in this office, I am order -

10141 Second Cindy Merry Christmas.
10142 Dwight You're number four.
10143 Dwight [singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
10144 Andy Yeah, but I'm number three.
10145 Michael That waitress was the one.
10146 Dwight Ah, no. [to Pam and Karen] You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.

10149 Michael How can you be sure?
10150 Dwight Ok, good

10153 Michael Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
10154 Dwight OK, this is stupid.

10157 Michael I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.
10158 Dwight No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.

10161 Michael I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
10162 Dwight Damn it!

10184 Ryan Thanks.
10185 Dwight [singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
10186 Michael C'mon Jim, let's go.
10187 Dwight Bye Pam.

10195 Jim Oh no, that would be great.
10196 Dwight Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.

10202 Jim Yes.
10203 Dwight [Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone." Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away]
10204 Dwight I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
10205 Michael Carol used to drink lattes.
10206 Dwight [off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?
10207 Michael She would get this little foam mustache...
10208 Dwight [still off screen] Carol had a mustache?
10209 Michael And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny.
10210 Dwight [off screen] What are you guys talking about?
10211 Michael She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
10212 Dwight Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
10213 Jim All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?
10214 Dwight Tape recorder.
10215 Jim For what?
10216 Dwight For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.

10219 Jim Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?
10220 Dwight What?
10221 Jim You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.
10222 Dwight I'm not.
10223 Jim Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
10224 Dwight I do not have a knife!
10225 Jim No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
10226 Dwight [leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
10227 Jim [picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
10228 Dwight Give me it. I am not.
10229 Phyllis Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...
10230 Dwight Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
10231 Karen Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo?
10232 Jim Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
10233 Dwight You can't see... You can't see my stomach.

10318 Michael I have a special assignment for you.
10319 Dwight Who's the target?
10320 Michael A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."
10321 Dwight What's it of?
10322 Michael Not important.
10323 Dwight Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
10324 Michael OK, forget it.
10325 Dwight OK, I accept it.

10357 Michael She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK.
10358 Dwight [to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?
10359 Dwight Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.
10360 Michael There an accident? Somebody hurt?
10361 Dwight No, it's... involves the photograph.

10382 Jim Definitely.
10383 Dwight I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
10384 Michael There are copies in the bathroom?
10385 Dwight There were. A lot of them.

10393 Darryl Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up [holds up an iPod inside speakers] You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.
10394 Dwight Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?
10395 Pam What? No, it's not... it's nothing.
10396 Dwight [takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.
10397 Pam Yeah.
10398 Dwight Yeah.
10399 Pam [Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.
10400 Dwight I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?

10431 Harvey Hi, Jim.
10432 Dwight That's what she said.

10435 Harvey I am Harvey, a computer. Jim sucks.
10436 Dwight It's going to be ok.

10439 Jim Yeah, you can.
10440 Dwight That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.

10443 Jim For this?
10444 Dwight Well, I don't have a lot of choices.

10459 Michael Damn it.
10460 Dwight Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .

10463 Jim Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
10464 Dwight I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.

10471 Harvey You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive.
10472 Dwight One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.

10487 Angela Everything ok? [Takes candy from Pam's desk]
10488 Dwight Everything is fine. You are in the clear.

10506 Michael So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.
10507 Dwight Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?

10511 Michael Dwight?
10512 Dwight Yup?
10513 Michael Here ya go. [throws laundry]
10514 Dwight Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?

10523 Michael It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.
10524 Dwight Come on!!

10530 Jim Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?
10531 Dwight Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.

10547 Stanley Mind? Nothing would delight me more.
10548 Dwight Leave the keys.
10549 Jim You still do that thing?
10550 Dwight Leave the keys!

10555 Jim After you sir.
10556 Dwight No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
10557 Jim Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.
10558 Dwight Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]

10600 Man 'Kay. 'Kay.
10601 Dwight Can I use your phone?
10602 Man Yeah, sure, go ahead.
10603 Dwight Thanks.
10604 Jim Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.
10605 Dwight [On Phone] One...
10606 Jim We have discount prices on ink cartridges...
10607 Dwight Three...
10608 Jim And, also, any forms that you are going to need...
10609 Dwight Seven...

10619 Man We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.
10620 Dwight Sure.

10623 Phone Please keep holding, your call is very important to us.
10624 Dwight Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.

10628 Kelly Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... . [Jim hangs up]
10629 Dwight Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.

10652 Michael Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.
10653 Dwight I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
10654 Jim Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.
10655 Dwight My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
10656 Jim We should go on a double date.
10657 Dwight No thank you.

10682 Jim Big deal.
10683 Dwight Hey, we nailed the sale!
10684 Michael Where were you this morning?
10685 Dwight I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
10686 Michael Why do you lie, liar?
10687 Dwight I am not a liar.
10688 Michael You are lying right now.
10689 Andy It sure seems like he is lying.
10690 Dwight Stay out of this, you!
10691 Michael I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
10692 Dwight Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
10693 Dwight I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
10694 Dwight For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts
10695 Dwight I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
10696 Dwight How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
10697 Dwight There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
10698 Dwight [in Staples uniform] I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.

10745 Staples Guy You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.
10746 Dwight [scoffs] Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.

10767 Michael Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
10768 Dwight Need any help?
10769 Lady Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.
10770 Dwight Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.

10797 Paris Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell.
10798 Dwight I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
10799 Paris So um, where were you workin' before this?
10800 Dwight Dunder-Mifflin.
10801 Paris What kind of company is that?
10802 Dwight [scoffs] Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
10803 Paris I never heard of 'em.
10804 Dwight Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?

10846 Andy Sure? Okay.
10847 Dwight [to customer] Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
10848 Michael Hey.
10849 Dwight Hey.
10850 Michael What's up?
10851 Dwight Same old.
10852 Michael Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
10853 Dwight Oh my God, she told you?
10854 Michael Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
10855 Dwight Accepted.
10856 Michael How's this place treating you?
10857 Dwight [scoffs] The boss isn't funny.
10858 Michael Oh, well.
10859 Dwight I don't get to wear my ties.
10860 Michael No. I'm sure.
10861 Dwight So?
10862 Michael So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
10863 Dwight I don't want to do your laundry anymore.

10872 Angela Welcome back.
10873 Dwight Thank you.
10874 Michael Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. [looks around the room] Not bad, huh?
10875 Dwight You did this for me? [camera pans to "Welcome Back Oscar" sign]

10890 Michael And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor? [hands broom to Dwight, though Oscar thinks he's handing it to him]
10891 Dwight Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]

10901 Elizabeth Oh my God, I would get so fat if I worked here.
10902 Dwight How do you know it's going to be a boy?

10911 Jan I'm closer to firing you.
10912 Dwight [Shakes head]

10920 Pam No. No. [Leaves]
10921 Dwight Are you near sighted or far sighted?

10924 Michael [Dwight is wearing a bra] You just twist your hand until something breaks.
10925 Dwight GAH!!!
10926 Dwight Ow.
10927 Michael Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam.
10928 Michael And remember no matter what, I will always love you.
10929 Dwight What if he's a murderer?
10930 Michael He's not going to be a murderer.
10931 Dwight Maybe that's how you die.
10932 Michael You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
10933 Dwight I want to do this.
10934 Michael Okay. From the top. Ready? Three-
10935 Dwight Action.

10971 Michael Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh! [Spanks himself]
10972 Dwight Alright! Uh! [Spanks himself]
10973 Michael Gay.
10974 Dwight What?

10996 Jim Absolutely not.
10997 Dwight I'm on it.
10998 Michael Well get on it. And make it happen.
10999 Dwight Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want-
11000 Jim Stop. That's disgusting.
11001 Dwight Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
11002 Jim Fine.
11003 Dwight I knew you would, Nancy.
11004 Jim Sally.
11005 Dwight No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
11006 Jim Blonde.
11007 Dwight Nice. Do you have any blonde women?

11039 Jim Have you ever seen a stripper before?
11040 Dwight Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases.

11044 Elizabeth I'm Elizabeth, I'm the dancer that was requested.
11045 Dwight Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
11046 Elizabeth I'm the stripper.
11047 Dwight Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
11048 Jim [Phone rings] Oh God.
11049 Dwight [Reading the text message] Is she hot? Text back, "Kind of."

11067 Michael Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat?
11068 Dwight I do! I want some man meat!

11111 Michael Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work!
11112 Dwight Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it.
11113 Elizabeth You want me to answer phones with my clothes on.
11114 Dwight We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.

11131 Michael Wow. Thank you.
11132 Dwight Care for a piece of chocolate?
11133 Ben Franklin Chocolate! Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States.
11134 Dwight Who is the king of Austria?
11135 Ben Franklin Joseph the 2nd.
11136 Dwight Who is the king of Prussia?
11137 Ben Franklin Fredrick Wilhelm the 3rd.
11138 Dwight Who is the king of England?
11139 Ben Franklin Why the tyrant King George, of course!
11140 Dwight I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure.

11157 Jim Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?
11158 Dwight What do you think?
11159 Jim In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.
11160 Jim [Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?
11161 Dwight Okay.
11162 Jim [Windows reboot sound] Altoid?
11163 Dwight Sure
11164 Jim [Windows reboot sound] Mint Dwight?
11165 Dwight Inbwit? Yes.
11166 Dwight [Windows reboot sound] [Dwight holds out his hand, sighs]
11167 Jim What are you doing?
11168 Dwight I...
11169 Jim What?
11170 Dwight I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]

11179 Stanley Unbelievable.
11180 Dwight Hello, Angela.
11181 Angela Hi, Dwight.
11182 Dwight You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
11183 Angela Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!
11184 Dwight The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.

11207 Michael Long story short
11208 Dwight Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
11209 Jim You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
11210 Dwight No way.
11211 Jim Did you ever see that movie?
11212 Dwight Of course I saw it.
11213 Dwight I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
11214 Jim You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.
11215 Dwight Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.

11225 Michael [whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking]
11226 Dwight It's a miracle.

11244 Michael Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
11245 Dwight Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
11246 Phyllis I don't have that, Dwight.
11247 Dwight Dammit, Phyllis!

11253 Pam Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks
11254 Dwight 'Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
11255 Uncle Al Who?
11256 Dwight The bride and groom? What are their names?
11257 Uncle Al Oh, I... I don't... I'm not sure.
11258 Dwight Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
11259 Uncle Al Okay, Okay. Where are we going?
11260 Dwight Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.

11307 Michael Come... Come on!
11308 Dwight I can't let you in, Michael.
11309 Michael Dwight, just...
11310 Dwight No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders.
11311 Michael Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.
11312 Dwight You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.

11351 Michael Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
11352 Dwight "Don't be an idiot." Changed my life.
11353 Dwight Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing.

11379 College Student ....Dude.
11380 Dwight ...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
11381 Pam Dwight, what are you doing?
11382 Dwight Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
11383 Karen Oh my God!
11384 Dwight BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!

11389 Michael I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
11390 Dwight We have... a bat... in the office.

11393 Jim Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
11394 Dwight At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
11395 Jim I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
11396 Dwight What? What's so wierd?

11399 Michael Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business
11400 Dwight [sighs] This is your job, Halpert.

11405 Jim What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
11406 Dwight No... no. One crisis at a time.
11407 Dwight If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.

11422 Jim The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
11423 Dwight I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
11424 Dwight Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
11425 Creed Sure.
11426 Dwight --to use sudden violence.
11427 Creed Okay.
11428 Dwight Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?

11442 Kelly Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
11443 Dwight Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!

11459 Jim So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
11460 Dwight Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
11461 Jim Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
11462 Dwight Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
11463 Dwight Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.

11476 Roy How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
11477 Dwight Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
11478 Meredith Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
11479 Dwight Hold still, woman!
11480 Meredith Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
11481 Dwight ...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.

11523 Jim Ok.
11524 Dwight Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...

11531 Michael Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
11532 Dwight I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.

11536 Jim Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
11537 Dwight The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.

11553 Pam He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
11554 Dwight [trumpet sounds]

11559 Roy No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
11560 Dwight It's early bird gets the worm.

11565 Pam This is over.
11566 Dwight Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.

11591 Michael Whatever.
11592 Dwight Thanks for inviting me along.

11602 Michael I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
11603 Dwight Don't break up you guys, you're great together.

11613 Roy I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
11614 Dwight Hello, Jan.

11626 Michael Ok.
11627 Dwight Talk to you later, Jan.

11634 Michael Beauty. Thank you sir!
11635 Dwight Salad.
11636 Michael Thank you.
11637 Dwight You dressed exactly like the servants.
11638 Michael Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
11639 Dwight Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
11640 Michael I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
11641 Dwight That would have been really embarrassing.
11642 Michael Yes.
11643 Dwight Crisis averted.

11651 Michael Oh, um, potato salad.
11652 Dwight It's from both of us.

11670 Angela No thank you, Roy.
11671 Dwight Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.

11684 Jan Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
11685 Dwight Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
11686 Dan Gore No.
11687 Dwight No? Then you are an idiot.

11710 Rachel Thank you.
11711 Dwight What's the square footage?
11712 David About 5,000.
11713 Dwight Does that include the garage?
11714 Michael Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
11715 Dwight I'm just...
11716 David I don't know
11717 Dwight It's a common question.
11718 Michael David, how much did this house cost?
11719 Dwight These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
11720 Rachel I'll show you around.
11721 Dwight Cool, let's start with the banisters.

11752 Creed I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
11753 Dwight Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].
11754 Rachel Uh, that's a guest room.
11755 Dwight Just the one window?
11756 Rachel [phone rings] Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me.
11757 Dwight Are those real pearls?
11758 Rachel Uh, yes.
11759 Dwight [tests smoke detector] Good.

11797 Toby [takes duck back] Yes.
11798 Dwight Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
11799 Child I don't know, it was here when I was born.
11800 Dwight I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
11801 Child I don't know.
11802 Dwight What do you know?

11855 Darryl Thank you.
11856 Dwight Pam, please call security!
11857 Michael Well...
11858 Dwight Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]

11899 Pam I don't know.
11900 Dwight Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.

11903 Kevin [as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
11904 Dwight Don't want it.

11907 Jan Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello. Come in. [exhales] Ah, Okay.
11908 Dwight Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.

11911 Jan That's my new assistant.
11912 Dwight No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.

11960 Jim Okay.
11961 Dwight What's this?

11964 Jim And what happens in this one?
11965 Dwight Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. "Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute"

11968 Jim Okay.
11969 Dwight Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.

11987 Michael Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---
11988 Dwight I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.

11991 Michael Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
11992 Dwight Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end.

12014 Ryan You know what? I didn't---
12015 Dwight Really?

12018 Kelly ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not.
12019 Dwight Mm, good stuff.

12022 Ryan Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
12023 Dwight Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]

12030 Michael [knock on door] Yeah.
12031 Dwight No need to thank me.
12032 Darryl You ready for me?
12033 Dwight I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro, from Heroes. That's a hero. Also, Bono.

12122 Jim Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
12123 Dwight When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
12124 Jim Boy I---
12125 Dwight No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?

12173 Pam Oh. Drew. Sorry.
12174 Dwight Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!

12177 Andy Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
12178 Dwight Michael! What's wrong?

12181 Jim Hey, Andy. How are you, man?
12182 Dwight Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?

12196 Creed [zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
12197 Dwight Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
12198 Jim Oh my God, there is a castle.
12199 Dwight Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
12200 Dwight No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael.
12201 Jim Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
12202 Michael Damn it.
12203 Dwight Ok, tell him that's not true.

12208 Pam Yeah...
12209 Dwight Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him!

12212 Pam Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
12213 Dwight Damn you.

12219 Michael Hmm.
12220 Dwight Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing.

12225 Darryl No! No no no no no! I said should you. You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift, you understand?
12226 Dwight Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.

12256 Michael Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
12257 Dwight Yeah!

12359 Michael They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
12360 Dwight Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!?
12361 Michael I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression---
12362 Dwight Wolves.
12363 Michael Nn--- Depression.
12364 Dwight Visual aids.
12365 Michael Yes.
12366 Dwight A quilt. Depression quilt?

12372 Kevin Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said "awesome" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
12373 Dwight [on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops!
12374 Michael Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or...
12375 Dwight We measured it once...
12376 Michael Go buy some watermelons.
12377 Dwight Seedless?

12387 Karen I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out.
12388 Dwight Ready?
12389 Michael Let's do it! Drop that sucker.
12390 Dwight [drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
12391 Michael BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.
12392 Dwight Okay.
12393 Michael Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
12394 Dwight Got it.
12395 Michael Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
12396 Dwight We're not allowed to use the baler.
12397 Michael Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
12398 Dwight I'm on it!
12399 Dwight I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
12400 Andy Thank you.
12401 Dwight It means nothing. I need you to do something for me.
12402 Andy Anything.
12403 Dwight Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
12404 Andy You mean a moon bounce.
12405 Dwight What do you think? You've got an hour.
12406 Andy I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
12407 Dwight Shunning resumed.
12408 Andy Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
12409 Dwight Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun.
12410 Dwight Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision.
12411 Michael Yes, thank you for seeing that.
12412 Dwight When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
12413 Michael I don't know if I wanna do this.
12414 Dwight Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
12415 Michael No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking.
12416 Dwight That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll!
12417 Michael Rock n' roll!
12418 Dwight Yeah!
12419 Michael That's right! I am not thinking.
12420 Dwight [imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
12421 Michael Yes! Yeah!
12422 Dwight [singing] Michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof!
12423 Michael Woo!
12424 Dwight [singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss!
12425 Michael Woo!
12426 Dwight [singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
12427 Michael I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar]
12428 Dwight [out of breath] Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
12429 Andy Whoa! What's the situation?
12430 Dwight [hesitates] Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
12431 Andy Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?
12432 Dwight Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
12433 Stanley Is it nice outside?
12434 Dwight It's gorgeous. Let's go!
12435 Stanley Do I need my jacket?
12436 Dwight No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on!
12437 Ryan Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
12438 Dwight Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go!
12439 Dwight [outside] Come on, hurry up you guys!
12440 Michael [on the roof] My life! Oh, my life...
12441 Dwight [on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?!
12442 Michael Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
12443 Dwight Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
12444 Michael Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!
12445 Dwight Is that the last year the data was available?
12446 Michael Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!
12447 Dwight Don't do anything rash!
12448 Michael Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
12449 Dwight I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
12450 Michael Okay... that's...
12451 Dwight you said to just...
12452 Michael That's the whole point, dummy.
12453 Dwight Okay, I'm on it!
12454 Michael Okay.
12455 Dwight Attention blue collar workers!
12456 Pam What are the odds that this is in any way real?
12457 Jim [Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question. What kind of bear is best?
12458 Dwight [walks in dressed as Jim] Pam.
12459 Dwight That's a ridiculous question.
12460 Pam Hey, Dwight. You look really nice today.
12461 Jim False. Black bear.
12462 Dwight [scoffs] Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
12463 Dwight Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought---
12464 Karen Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp.
12465 Jim Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.
12466 Dwight Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
12467 Dwight Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!

12470 Karen No.
12471 Dwight You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk] Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!

12474 Karen I'm good. Thanks.
12475 Dwight Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL!
12476 Jim [Dwight imitates the "Jim face"] Look at that.
12477 Pam [on phone] Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?
12478 Dwight I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible "Jim faces"]

12481 Phyllis [on phone] I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
12482 Dwight Ah-luh-luh, a little comment. Muh.

12486 Michael Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime.
12487 Dwight Cri-Man-Squa?

12514 Michael No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
12515 Dwight Yes! You are entering the "No Spin Zone!"
12516 Pam We're having a press conference?
12517 Michael No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
12518 Dwight Not! [scoffs]

12564 Michael OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
12565 Dwight On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair.
12566 Dwight First rule in road-side beet sales
12567 Dwight [Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey! [snaps twice] Look sharp! [to Chad Lite] Hey! Uh, Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute.
12568 Chad Lite Hi, uh---
12569 Dwight And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
12570 Chad Lite Scranton Times. Chad Lite, "Lighter Side of Life."
12571 Dwight And "Breaking Corporate News."
12572 Chad Lite And obits.
12573 Dwight Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance.
12574 Chad Lite Oh...
12575 Dwight Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
12576 Chad Lite Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---
12577 Dwight [shuts door on him] Great.

12596 Creed When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
12597 Dwight Emergency dentist appointment.

12602 Michael And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
12603 Dwight [snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.

12635 Barbara I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having s*x?
12636 Dwight May I point out that the s*x appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.
12637 Michael OK...
12638 Dwight I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having s*x in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right.

12652 Barbara Mm-hmm.
12653 Dwight It's non-transferable...

12666 Michael "Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that."
12667 Dwight Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
12668 Michael That's how devoted I am to this job.
12669 Dwight I'm just saying...
12670 Michael I know.
12671 Dwight They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.
12672 Michael I understand that, Dwight.
12673 Dwight You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
12674 Michael Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?
12675 Dwight Cut.

12717 Pam I don't think we really need that, Michael.
12718 Dwight That is a demerit.

12721 Pam You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
12722 Dwight You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
12723 Andy Think we'll find him?
12724 Jim Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
12725 Dwight Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
12726 Dwight [scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
12727 Andy [pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?
12728 Jim Lay it on me.
12729 Dwight No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]
12730 Dwight Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
12731 Andy Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
12732 Jim Now that sounds serious.
12733 Dwight Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
12734 Dwight Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
12735 Andy Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
12736 Jim Which would be me.
12737 Dwight You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
12738 Dwight That is correct.

12741 Pam Good luck, Michael.
12742 Dwight What's a dis... what's that?

12755 Michael Thank you.
12756 Dwight [jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!

12776 Creed If that's flashing, then lock me up.
12777 Dwight [phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/s*x predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.

12780 Ryan [whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
12781 Dwight Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.

12784 Pam Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
12785 Dwight Ugh. I'm hanging up.

12788 Pam Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
12789 Dwight You have information about the s*x predator?

12792 Angela What is so funny?
12793 Dwight Where?

12796 Kevin I'm guessing not.
12797 Dwight [hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!

12822 Hunter [on speakerphone] You got it, Jan.
12823 Dwight Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
12824 Michael [exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
12825 Dwight Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
12826 Michael OK.
12827 Dwight [lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
12828 Michael This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.
12829 Dwight Look at that one.
12830 Michael Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]
12831 Michael Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
12832 Dwight Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his pen1s - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
12833 Jim [raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
12834 Dwight Answer
12835 Pam Phallus?
12836 Dwight Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.

12840 Karen Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute." This is ridiculous.
12841 Dwight Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
12842 Karen Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
12843 Dwight Desperate times call for desperate measures.

12847 Michael See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
12848 Dwight Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?

12851 Michael Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
12852 Dwight [eating banana] Mm, less than three.
12853 Michael That is not current.
12854 Dwight You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
12855 Jim Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
12856 Dwight Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.

12863 Michael OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a pen1s, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
12864 Dwight Alien. Blagh!

12878 Michael I have to know whether you're serious or not.
12879 Dwight I wish I could menstruate.
12880 Dwight If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.

12887 Michael OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!
12888 Dwight Have you finished with the sketch?
12889 Pam Yeah.
12890 Dwight Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
12891 Pam Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
12892 Dwight Hmm.
12893 Dwight [Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.

12908 Andy I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
12909 Dwight Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
12910 Andy This guy looks like a real deviant.
12911 Dwight No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
12912 Andy Aye, aye, Cap'n.
12913 Dwight More like, "Aye, aye, General."

12916 Michael Many women are competent drivers. [scraping] OK. Come on.
12917 Dwight [marks Scranton with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we know.

13001 Group One. Two. Three! Go! Do it! Go, Michael.
13002 Dwight OK, where does it hurt?

13005 Creed On the go that's after three.
13006 Dwight No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.

13009 Group One, two, three, go!
13010 Dwight [reading from screen] "Abdomen. Menses."
13011 Dwight No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
13012 Michael Maybe.
13013 Michael Don't, don't.
13014 Dwight "The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it."
13015 Dwight [walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!

13018 Pam About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
13019 Dwight [standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB!
13020 Dwight Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
13021 Michael I'm not going to give it to you.
13022 Michael That's possible.
13023 Dwight [falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!

13028 Pam David Wallace is on line one.
13029 Dwight Aggggh, that stings!

13056 David I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
13057 Dwight The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act." And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats!"

13060 David Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
13061 Dwight [finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.

13100 Michael Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
13101 Dwight Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
13102 Michael Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
13103 Dwight I hope there will be management parables.

13113 Michael Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
13114 Dwight Yes!
13115 Michael Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
13116 Michael Jim Halpert. Pros
13117 Dwight I choose Michael!
13118 Michael I'm not playing.
13119 Dwight OK, temp.
13120 Michael Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
13121 Michael We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
13122 Dwight We will be called Gryffindor.
13123 Jim Really? Not Slytherin?
13124 Dwight Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
13125 Jim I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
13126 Dwight He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
13127 Jim [starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
13128 Dwight OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.

13152 Jim Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
13153 Dwight [to Ryan] Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
13154 Ryan Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
13155 Dwight What are you saying?
13156 Ryan You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
13157 Dwight OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
13158 Ryan That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
13159 Dwight I am trying to bring team spirit.

13163 Michael [off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook]
13164 Dwight [at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you b*st*rd! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!

13177 Oscar Turkey is a healthy meat.
13178 Dwight It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]

13188 Michael The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
13189 Dwight You're leaving?

13198 Michael 13 hot dogs, everybody!
13199 Dwight Damn it!
13200 Creed [holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
13201 Dwight Sabotage.
13202 Angela What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
13203 Dwight No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
13204 Angela I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
13205 Dwight If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.

13218 Oscar If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
13219 Dwight [Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa....
13220 Michael One. Two. Three.
13221 Dwight Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
13222 Michael Excellent!
13223 Dwight Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
13224 Andy I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
13225 Dwight That's not why you lost.
13226 Andy Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
13227 Dwight Yeah, right.
13228 Andy Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
13229 Dwight [bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?

13343 Kevin What's different about you? You look worse.
13344 Dwight [Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?

13381 Pam After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
13382 Dwight Michael is gone.
13383 Michael [knock on door] Yeah.
13384 Andy Hail to the chief!
13385 Dwight You wanted to see me?
13386 Dwight My first order of business
13387 Michael Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
13388 Andy My first order of business
13389 Dwight But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry] Thank you.
13390 Dwight As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
13391 Michael Okay. Uh...
13392 Andy Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
13393 Dwight [cries harder] Thank you, Michael.

13396 Hunter Uh, administrative assistant.
13397 Dwight [sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.

13400 Hunter I think she's comin' in... later.
13401 Dwight [sobbing] Thank you.

13411 Karen It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
13412 Dwight You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.

13415 Karen [confused] Oh. Okay.
13416 Dwight I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.

13419 Karen Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
13420 Dwight Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.

13423 Jim So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
13424 Dwight Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills.

13427 Karen [looks annoyed]
13428 Dwight Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.

13431 Michael No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
13432 Dwight Do you accept?

13473 Kevin Yeah.
13474 Dwight Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.

13477 Kevin Will do.
13478 Dwight Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent.

13481 Oscar Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
13482 Dwight Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings!

13485 Stanley I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
13486 Dwight Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.

13489 Pam [smiles]
13490 Dwight Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is "me." Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you!

13519 Angela Wha? Who gave you that advice?
13520 Dwight Listen up. Let's start... from the ground up. Where does paper come from?

13523 Michael I have to buy another place.
13524 Dwight Trees! And where do trees grow?

13527 Oscar You're not sure that you have the job.
13528 Dwight Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head "no"] Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
13529 Michael I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time.
13530 Stanley Liquid.
13531 Dwight How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
13532 Dwight Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck.
13533 Angela No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
13534 Stanley I don't want it.
13535 Dwight No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
13536 Dwight Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
13537 Angela [smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
13538 Stanley Make it 100.
13539 Dwight [squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
13540 Dwight We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
13541 Jim Oh hey, Dwight.
13542 Stanley No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
13543 Dwight I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.
13544 Dwight What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
13545 Jim Does my room have cable?
13546 Stanley The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
13547 Dwight No. And the sheets are made of fire.
13548 Dwight Okay---
13549 Jim Can I change rooms?
13550 Andy That's it!
13551 Dwight Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
13552 Dwight What---
13553 Jim Can I have a late checkout?
13554 Andy Class is canceled, everybody out!
13555 Dwight I'll have to talk to the manager.
13556 Dwight No wait, what are you doing?!
13557 Jim You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
13558 Andy I'm punishing them.
13559 Dwight I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan!
13560 Dwight No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled.
13561 Jim Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
13562 Everyone [grumbling, getting loud]
13563 Dwight Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.

13566 Oscar What--- What are you winking for?
13567 Dwight Eighty thousand dollars a year.
13568 Dwight Zip your lid!
13569 Dwight Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.

13572 David Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
13573 Dwight Yes you will.

13649 Jan I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
13650 Dwight It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]

13653 Jan Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
13654 Dwight It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!

13729 Jan And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
13730 Dwight To intimidate my subordinates.

13733 Michael No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent.
13734 Dwight It was Andy's idea.
13735 Dwight Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps] Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name] Andrew Bernard.

13740 Michael No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids.
13741 Dwight No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael.

13744 Pam Did... Karen get the job?
13745 Dwight What did I say!?
13746 Michael [to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.
13747 Pam [to Jim] Good luck.
13748 Dwight Pam, hello.

13751 Pam I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
13752 Dwight I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
13753 Dwight I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color?

13756 David I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
13757 Dwight Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table?

13760 David Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy.
13761 Dwight What is the capital of Maine?

13764 David Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
13765 Dwight Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.

13768 David Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
13769 Dwight You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.

13774 Jim Oh, no, absolutely.
13775 Dwight [Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.

13778 Jim [hands David his papers] There you go.
13779 Dwight This interview is over. I'll let you know.

13836 Michael I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
13837 Dwight Where?

13852 Angela Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.
13853 Dwight No need we can just check the security tapes.

13862 Pam Ah.
13863 Dwight It's only Meredith.

13866 Pam Angela, I'm sorry.
13867 Dwight Hey... Why did you do it?

13870 Pam I'm more of a dog person.
13871 Dwight Was she talkin' back?

13874 Jim So what's your strategy for this race?
13875 Dwight Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?

13909 Angela There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.
13910 Dwight [Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!

13913 Angela [sighs] All right!
13914 Dwight You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.

13917 Ryan Yes Michael?
13918 Dwight [sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.

13935 Ryan I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.
13936 Dwight Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.

13939 Ryan [sigh]
13940 Dwight Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.

13944 Pam Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.
13945 Dwight Hey monkey, what's up?

13948 Pam And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.
13949 Dwight Sure.

13952 Pam I don't think so.
13953 Dwight Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what

13956 Michael That's possible. Look into that.
13957 Dwight So what do you need me to do?
13958 Jim Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
13959 Angela I wrote it out.
13960 Dwight Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
13961 Dwight Mm-hmm.

14067 Michael Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
14068 Dwight Mm-hmm.

14073 Angela No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.
14074 Dwight On your marks, get set...

14092 Pam Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place.
14093 Dwight Hey monkey.

14096 Pam Darn it.
14097 Dwight Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.

14100 Michael No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
14101 Dwight Sparkles, the white one, is dead.

14104 Michael Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.
14105 Dwight That was the sick one, right?

14108 Creed [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar sitting at a table] Can we get another round?
14109 Dwight No.

14112 Creed Thanks.
14113 Dwight Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.

14116 Oscar More or less.
14117 Dwight So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.

14120 Michael That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.
14121 Dwight Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
14122 Dwight You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.

14149 Toby Yeah.
14150 Dwight How ya feeling, better?

14153 Angela Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.
14154 Dwight Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
14155 Dwight She's only a cat.
14156 Angela The vet is removing all of Sprinkles organs right now and sending them to the lab.
14157 Angela You never... you don't like them.
14158 Dwight I am a farmer Angela.
14159 Dwight Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
14160 Angela What does that mean?
14161 Oscar Dwight please!
14162 Dwight OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
14163 Michael Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
14164 Angela You did kill her!?
14165 Dwight No, I have not.
14166 Dwight I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
14167 Michael Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
14168 Angela You put her in my freezer.
14169 Dwight I do not respect her, but I will go.
14170 Dwight It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.

14173 Toby Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...
14174 Dwight Well I'm not responsible for that!

14177 Toby Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.
14178 Dwight Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.

14181 Stanley I'm... um, Catholic.
14182 Dwight It's nothing, I'm robbing her.

14185 Darryl Presbyterian.
14186 Dwight It's fine. What?

14189 Pam Oh me too.
14190 Dwight I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.

14193 Pam [puts hand up for high five] Same religion.
14194 Dwight I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.

14199 Angela That's why we're cursed.
14200 Dwight Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?

14216 Toby He couldn't have made it a circle?
14217 Dwight As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
14218 Michael [bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]
14219 Dwight Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.

14228 Jim Well, you're probably dehydrated.
14229 Dwight Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?

14232 Jim Glass of water would be a start.
14233 Dwight Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.

14238 Pam I'm still having a nice day.
14239 Dwight Just doing my job.

14254 Pam I know you Michael, I saw you naked.
14255 Dwight So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.

14258 Michael Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.
14259 Dwight Mm-hmm.

14262 Michael Hey Mer. How ya doing?
14263 Dwight No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.

14266 Michael It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
14267 Dwight Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.

14280 Michael Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
14281 Dwight Take a stand!
14282 Pam I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim]
14283 Dwight I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.

14332 Pam Yeah, great.
14333 Dwight What?

14355 Ryan Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. [Michael retreats back to office] [to Kelly] Where do you wanna go?
14356 Dwight It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.

14364 Kelly You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it. [Ryan hesitates and takes her hand and they exit]
14365 Dwight Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!
14366 Michael I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]
14367 Dwight Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?

14370 Angela Very much. How's your meat?
14371 Dwight Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]
14372 Pam Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk]
14373 Dwight Dry. Delicious.

14377 Michael It's been opened.
14378 Dwight I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
14379 Dwight Oh, that's funny.

14384 Andy Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?
14385 Dwight Are you enjoying your mineral water?

14390 Phyllis Did you plan it?
14391 Dwight Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.
14392 Dwight [enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!

14396 Pam [reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?
14397 Dwight No, please don't do this, monkey.
14398 Dwight [leaving] We'll bill you.

14421 Phyllis Did you get any clients back?
14422 Dwight To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].

14427 Michael Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.
14428 Dwight It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.

14432 Toby I just really like you.
14433 Dwight And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises]

14438 Jim I know. I love it there.
14439 Dwight You haven't buried her yet?

14444 Jim Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
14445 Dwight Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.

14448 Angela I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles! [walks away]
14449 Dwight Dry rot?

14461 Jim Oh.
14462 Dwight Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.

14465 Toby Uh huh.
14466 Dwight You're welcome.

14469 Toby Let's just wait and see what happens. [whispers] You know?
14470 Dwight Yes... [whispers] I miss you.

14475 Jim Oh, OK.
14476 Dwight Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.

14479 Jim Great. [Jim and Pam walk away]
14480 Dwight Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.

14558 Michael OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
14559 Dwight What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?

14562 Michael Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
14563 Dwight Got it. [Andy's hand goes up]

14571 Kelly Can we speak privately about our relationship?
14572 Dwight Michael, wait. Let me go.

14575 Michael Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave]
14576 Dwight Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.

14583 Creed We're screwed.
14584 Dwight Yeah.

14587 Creed Us? You and me. The old timers.
14588 Dwight Thank you.

14595 Pam No.. [in awe]
14596 Dwight [in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?

14599 Pam No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.
14600 Dwight Ah, that's a pain in the ass.

14603 Pam You didn't say anything to me?
14604 Dwight Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.

14607 Pam Can you believe that...
14608 Dwight Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.

14611 Jim Oh no, we're just sitting here.
14612 Dwight The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]

14655 Phyllis Did you even try?
14656 Dwight Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.

14659 Phyllis I can't see half of the things. [adjusts glasses]
14660 Dwight And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.

14665 Ryan Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.
14666 Dwight Please, come back.

14669 Ryan I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.
14670 Dwight Remember what we had Larry?

14683 Kelly We have a date!
14684 Dwight I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
14685 Dwight Hello.
14686 Michael That is true.
14687 Angela Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?
14688 Dwight Like Angela in accounting.
14689 Dwight Really?
14690 Michael Yes, she is nuts.
14691 Angela Yes.
14692 Dwight Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
14693 Dwight I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.

14735 Michael [holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?
14736 Dwight You don't know?

14745 Jan He's such a snake.
14746 Dwight He's not coming back, it's over Michael.

14751 Michael What is that... word?
14752 Dwight Accept it, why would he come back?

14755 Michael So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
14756 Dwight That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.

14769 Ryan Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.
14770 Dwight [in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.

14773 Ryan [notices pictures on the wall] Ohh... man.
14774 Dwight That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.

14779 Michael Have a seat.
14780 Dwight Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.

14783 Michael Have a seat. Like everybody else.
14784 Dwight No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.

14787 Michael Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
14788 Dwight It can't mean that! There's a lake there!

14791 Michael Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
14792 Dwight This is the lake!

14795 Michael No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?" [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.
14796 Dwight No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]
14797 Jim Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
14798 Dwight Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!

14801 Michael I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
14802 Dwight I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]

14805 Robert Dunder Michael Scott?
14806 Dwight Fine.
14807 Michael [puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]
14808 Michael Good, that is what's most important.
14809 Dwight Oh, yeah. Yes!
14810 Dwight Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.

14813 Ryan Michael, [gets up] can I talk to you a second?
14814 Dwight I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone]

14817 Ryan We have actual work to do.
14818 Dwight Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.

14821 Michael Bob, how old are you?
14822 Dwight [speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.

14825 Michael Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
14826 Dwight Yes!

14830 Jim There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.
14831 Dwight Woo!

14836 Michael We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall]
14837 Dwight Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again.

14842 Michael Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.
14843 Dwight No no no the first part.

14848 Kevin Dude, you gotta believe.
14849 Dwight Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you.

14854 Jim [to Pam] Wait for it.
14855 Dwight You didn't have to.

14864 Pam Hello.
14865 Dwight Blah.

14870 Pam Um... uh... I'll get back to you.
14871 Dwight Uhh.

14876 DunMiff/sys [on monitor] You beat me. You are the superior being.
14877 Dwight What?

14880 Meredith I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.
14881 Dwight Coopers has calamari.

14885 Michael Alright who wants to party?
14886 Dwight Tokyo?

14891 Michael Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
14892 Dwight Yes.

14897 Michael I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
14898 Dwight Okay.
14899 Jim MmmHmm...
14900 Angela Thank you.
14901 Dwight Nice.

14906 Andy He beat the computer.
14907 Dwight Woo-hoo.

14912 Michael This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.
14913 Dwight Yum.

14937 Michael Yeah.
14938 Dwight That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.

14942 Angela Chocolates? Someone famous?
14943 Dwight Later on.
14944 Dwight Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?

14948 Angela Cool music.
14949 Dwight And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.

14954 Angela Confetti.
14955 Dwight I started a fire with my cheese pita.
14956 Dwight I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.

14960 Angela Go-Go dancers?
14961 Dwight I date Indian girls.

14966 Angela I can't do this.
14967 Dwight Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
14968 Dwight You believe a computer can beat me?

14972 Angela I can't do it.
14973 Dwight I don't get that, I don't understand that.
14974 Dwight Well I will prove you wrong.

14979 Michael Wanna head back?
14980 Dwight We'll see.
14981 Michael No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!
14982 Dwight Yeah, let's go.

14986 Pam Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.
14987 Dwight I think she's efficient.

14990 Stanley No I'm not.
14991 Dwight I hadn't noticed.

14994 Voice of Thomas Dean I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall.
14995 Dwight [impatient sigh]

14998 Andy And this is where I will record your sales.
14999 Dwight I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
15000 Dwight Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.
15001 Andy Isn't that part of the fun?
15002 Andy And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.
15003 Dwight No. I think you should date Kelly.

15006 Andy I can't tell if he's mocking me.
15007 Dwight Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby.
15008 Dwight Just ignore him.

15015 Michael Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
15016 Dwight I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.

15021 Michael Same thing.
15022 Dwight Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me.

15055 Andy Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box. [Camera pans to Kevin giving an "are you kidding me?" look]
15056 Dwight Got it. Carb up.

15059 Andy Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?
15060 Dwight Hey, you wanna win? You gotta fuel like a winner.

15063 Andy Hello.
15064 Dwight Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute.

15067 Andy They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.
15068 Dwight Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.

15077 Michael Hey
15078 Dwight Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.

15081 Michael Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
15082 Dwight What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure. I'll hold.

15095 Pizza guy [shrugs]
15096 Dwight It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.

15134 Michael Just...
15135 Dwight I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.

15146 Michael Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
15147 Dwight We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world.

15155 Pizza guy Sales?
15156 Dwight Ohhhhhh!

15160 Meredith Three hundred and five.
15161 Dwight What did you just call him?

15164 Meredith Oop. It just made another sale. Three eighty.
15165 Dwight What did you say?

15170 Andy Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?
15171 Dwight I can make him talk, Michael.

15195 Michael Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
15196 Dwight No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]

15199 Michael Trouble. Okay, alright.
15200 Dwight Fine. Good.

15203 Michael He said no.
15204 Dwight Yeah.

15207 Michael No, no.
15208 Dwight I do not look worried.
15209 Jim Okay.
15210 DunMiff/sys [on monitor] You do look worried.
15211 Dwight Listen up kid. [pops balloon with his hands] I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.

15216 Jim Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper.
15217 Dwight Hey!

15236 Jim Oh yeah?
15237 Dwight It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
15238 Darryl Kelly ordered this online.
15239 Angela Will you help me put it over there?
15240 Dwight What are you doing? I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.

15243 Angela Okay.
15244 Dwight Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did!

15247 Andy I stole it!
15248 Dwight Return it! Return it now!

15251 Pam Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself.
15252 Dwight Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.

15265 Jim Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
15266 Dwight I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them.
15267 Kevin Different stuff.
15268 Dwight Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good.

15283 Jim Wow, can we make it a different moment?
15284 Dwight Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.

15287 Manager Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start.
15288 Dwight I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?
15289 Ryan And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.
15290 Dwight Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?

15293 Ryan Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear.
15294 Dwight Huh?!

15297 Angela Ow! What are you doing?
15298 Dwight Did you see the board?

15308 Jim Yeah.
15309 Dwight [smiles]

15312 Jim It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.
15313 Dwight [kicks open bathroom door] If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!

15318 Michael Leaving Pennsylvania.
15319 Dwight Ahh-chaa!

15322 Michael One for me one for Jan.
15323 Dwight I'm just scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.

15326 Michael You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?
15327 Dwight Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!

15330 Michael Wanna come over Friday?
15331 Dwight You had to, what other choice did you have?

15334 Michael After work you guys...
15335 Dwight Well, yeah.

15348 Jim Yep.
15349 Dwight What will you do?

15352 Jim Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?
15353 Dwight Yeah.

15356 Jim Yep.
15357 Dwight So, I'm paying full price?

15360 Michael You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.
15361 Dwight Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more.

15366 Michael Yeah. I withdrew too.
15367 Dwight Now what?
15368 Andy Four! Three! Two! One!
15369 Michael Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
15370 Dwight Yes!
15371 Dwight Alright. Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.

15449 Pam You're being gross.
15450 Dwight [picks up phone] Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. [opens book, then picks up phone] Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!

15453 Pam What moves?
15454 Dwight None of your business, Jim.

15457 Pam I can't believe that's not working.
15458 Dwight It is not a B and B.
15459 Andy Yeah.
15460 Dwight Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.

15463 Andy Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.
15464 Dwight I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.

15467 Andy Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.
15468 Dwight Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.

15471 Andy Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.
15472 Dwight Where did you read that?

15475 Andy Yeah.
15476 Dwight Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
15477 Pam Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.
15478 Dwight How many in your party?

15481 Kevin I do gamble Michael.
15482 Dwight We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?

15491 Michael Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.
15492 Dwight One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.

15495 Darryl I have my daughter tonight
15496 Dwight You took that with you.

15499 Darryl My daughter.
15500 Dwight You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.

15503 Darryl That was cold.
15504 Dwight My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has s*x with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.

15565 Creed Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.
15566 Dwight We have three rooms, each with a different theme.

15569 Creed Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.
15570 Dwight American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.

15575 Creed You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up "get out of jail free" cards, those things cost thousands.
15576 Dwight I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?

15579 Creed Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.
15580 Dwight No.

15583 Creed Exactly.
15584 Dwight No. Jim, come on.

15587 Michael I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life.
15588 Dwight Mose, bags! Now!
15589 Michael I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!
15590 Dwight Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.

15615 Oscar Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.
15616 Dwight Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!

15650 Nick A few more minutes is a waste of our time.
15651 Dwight Stupid.

15654 Nick This is a trading game.
15655 Dwight No.

15658 Nick You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That's how Vikram does it.
15659 Dwight Maybe you should. Whatever.

15665 Pam Table making never seemed so possible.
15666 Dwight [reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. "Harry?" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.

15670 Vikram Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.
15671 Dwight I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.

15704 Michael You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.
15705 Dwight Uhh-mmm [moaning]

15708 Michael I actually wrote a movie.
15709 Dwight [incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.

15712 Michael I'm writing one, yeah.
15713 Dwight Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling]

15716 Michael Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
15717 Dwight [sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]

15721 Jim Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
15722 Dwight [Jim knocks on Dwight's door, crying stops] Come in. Did you have another nightmare?

15725 Jim Yeah?
15726 Dwight Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.

15731 Pam Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.
15732 Dwight Is everything satisfactory with your stay?

15735 Oscar Jan, he went running that way.
15736 Dwight Great.

15739 Michael [singing] Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back.
15740 Dwight Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.

15776 Michael I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
15777 Dwight [takes a ruler and shoves it between his desk and Jim's, knocking Jim's files on the floor] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.

15785 Jan It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.
15786 Dwight Pam.
15787 Michael It looks cute though.
15788 Jim You okay?
15789 Dwight I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in]

15862 Jim You playing that game again?
15863 Dwight Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
15864 Jim Oh it has losers.
15865 Dwight I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around]

15880 Andy I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?
15881 Dwight We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
15882 Andy We'll use code names.
15883 Dwight Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
15884 Andy That's not different enough.
15885 Dwight Dwike?

15916 Michael Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative"?
15917 Dwight Yes.

15999 Andy Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.
16000 Dwight Andy, I can't hear this right now.
16001 Andy No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, "Oh D, oh D."
16002 Dwight She called you D?
16003 Andy Yeah. D for Andy.
16004 Dwight Oh D.
16005 Andy Oh D.
16006 Dwight [whispers] Oh D.

16047 Jim [slinking out of the room] Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
16048 Dwight He looks like your twin.

16051 Jim I... will... [gives up and walks away]
16052 Dwight I will know.

16055 Michael Um, wanted[/b]
16056 Dwight I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah.

16138 Michael What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House.
16139 Dwight Found him!

16151 Jim What are we doing?
16152 Dwight Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
16153 Michael What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
16154 Dwight Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.

16164 Michael In your face
16165 Dwight Yow!

16168 Jim No, I'm not calling Karen.
16169 Dwight He's lying.
16170 Michael Yep, get it.
16171 Jim What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
16172 Dwight [throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!
16173 Jim Are you kidding me?
16174 Dwight No communication with the outside world Jim.
16175 Michael It had to be done, it had to be done.
16176 Jim Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
16177 Dwight Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot.

16185 Michael Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
16186 Dwight Or real bombs.
16187 Michael No, no, not real bombs.
16188 Dwight Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.

16192 Jim No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
16193 Dwight Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.

16209 Michael What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?
16210 Dwight I'm peeing in this empty can.
16211 Jim Oh my God!
16212 Michael Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
16213 Dwight Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
16214 Jim Michael, watch the road!
16215 Dwight Hey, you're making me spray!

16219 Jim Pull over, pull over!
16220 Dwight I think I cut my pen1s on the lid!

16232 Jim I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.
16233 Dwight Believe it.

16238 Michael You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
16239 Dwight And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
16240 Jim No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
16241 Dwight Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
16242 Jim Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
16243 Dwight Okay, Jim.
16244 Jim Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
16245 Dwight Let's move! Move, move, move, move!

16262 Michael [from the walkie-talkie] We are in a stairwell.
16263 Dwight [from the walkie-talkie] We are climbing some stairs.
16264 Dwight I'm breathing heavily.
16265 Jim Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
16266 Dwight Well...
16267 Michael There's a guy, there's a guy.
16268 Dwight There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?
16269 Michael Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
16270 Dwight I can see the security guard's eyes.
16271 Jim No, no, don't do anything to them.
16272 Dwight I have to do something to his eyes.
16273 Dwight The eyes are the groin of the head.

16279 Michael Aha! [crashing]
16280 Dwight My hip bone!
16281 Michael We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us.
16282 Dwight Don't leave us!
16283 Michael Save yourself!
16284 Dwight Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!

16288 Michael Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
16289 Dwight I'm losing control of my bladder.
16290 Jim Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
16291 Dwight Did you say Karen?

16302 Jim You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
16303 Dwight Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.

16306 Karen Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?
16307 Dwight Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
16308 Karen I'm taking Stanley.
16309 Dwight Then we will burn Utica to the ground.

16354 Michael OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.
16355 Dwight [winks] I'm on it. [leaves room]
16356 Michael OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what...
16357 Dwight Let's see if any of these will work. [clears the front of Michael's desk]
16358 Michael Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.
16359 Dwight I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place." Well I say, "It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose."

16373 Jim That'd be great.
16374 Dwight Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way[/b]
16375 Michael This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.
16376 Dwight No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
16377 Michael Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
16378 Dwight I would make sure that you were dead.
16379 Michael Well...
16380 Dwight First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
16381 Michael You...
16382 Dwight And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
16383 Michael You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.
16384 Dwight What are you doing?
16385 Michael I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?
16386 Dwight It would be better if you were unconscious.
16387 Michael No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
16388 Dwight Do you want to do this right or not?

16413 Pam [smiles] Hmm.
16414 Dwight We're here. [gets out of the car]
16415 Michael Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
16416 Dwight [leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow]
16417 Dwight Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
16418 Dwight Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.

16425 Jim Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes]
16426 Dwight Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles]
16427 Michael What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
16428 Dwight I'm just --
16429 Michael Stop.
16430 Dwight Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.
16431 Michael Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
16432 Dwight Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
16433 Michael Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]
16434 Dwight Good luck, Michael.

16458 Michael [to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...
16459 Dwight I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.

16477 Michael I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.
16478 Dwight Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.
16479 Michael Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.
16480 Dwight About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].

16493 Michael Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.
16494 Dwight Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.

16522 Michael Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth]
16523 Dwight Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]

16693 Meredith Don't patronize me.
16694 Dwight All right! What is going on here?
16695 Jim Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
16696 Jim [Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?
16697 Dwight I told you.
16698 Dwight All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, JÃ¶rg RoÃŸkopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.

16740 Pam [walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?
16741 Dwight Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.

16745 Pam I'll make the call.
16746 Dwight Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.

16799 Michael [yells] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [Jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up Michael's dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv] THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! [Jan goes upstairs crying.]
16800 Dwight Thank you Michael.
16801 Woman I'm gonna get going.
16802 Michael All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
16803 Dwight Fine. Get outta here.

16810 Michael You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
16811 Dwight Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
16812 Jim Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.
16813 Officer 1 Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?
16814 Dwight Michael, what time should I be arriving?

16819 Michael Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
16820 Dwight Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying]

16834 Michael Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
16835 Dwight [puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.

16844 Jim Really?
16845 Dwight You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.

16848 Pam We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine]
16849 Dwight I'm gonna take you home Michael.

16852 Michael Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
16853 Dwight Alright. [leads Michael away]

17017 Jan Coming! [Dwight and a woman are at the door holding wine glasses and a cooler]
17018 Dwight Hello.
17019 Jan What are you doing here?
17020 Dwight We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?

17033 Jan I hate my life.
17034 Dwight So can we come in?
17035 Dwight Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
17036 Jan [crying] I'm just gonna check on dinner. [Jan gets up from the table]
17037 Dwight Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
17038 Angela I hate beet salad.
17039 Woman It's actually really good.
17040 Dwight Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.

17053 Pam And now you guys are dating?
17054 Dwight Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.

17132 Michael Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
17133 Dwight [gets up from chair] Write legibly people.

17167 Michael Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah.
17168 Dwight OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
17169 Michael Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
17170 Dwight I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
17171 Michael That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.
17172 Dwight [on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
17173 Dwight The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
17174 Michael She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.
17175 Dwight She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
17176 Michael Oh, God. Oh...
17177 Dwight Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.
17178 Jim Michael, you didn't even know her.
17179 Michael Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
17180 Dwight Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]

17255 Michael I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs]
17256 Dwight You know what you need? Closure.
17257 Michael You're right. What do you mean though?
17258 Dwight There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
17259 Michael Hmm.
17260 Dwight Come on. I'll drive.

17269 Michael [looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?
17270 Dwight I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
17271 Michael God.
17272 Dwight Yeah.
17273 Michael She was so innocent.
17274 Dwight She was stoned apparently.
17275 Michael You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?
17276 Dwight You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
17277 Michael Oh, you move on.
17278 Dwight Yeah.

17289 Michael Return.
17290 Dwight Rhythm and blues...

17299 Michael Hmm...
17300 Dwight You've got a ton of dandruff.

17323 Oscar Why?
17324 Dwight Taste good too.

17327 Toby More like "Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday." [more laughs] [Toby puts his hand on Pam's knee, everyone stares, Toby removes his hand] I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now. [runs out of lobby and climbs the fence and jogs away]
17328 Dwight Wow! Lot of calories.

17331 Ryan Why wouldn't they let me dance?
17332 Dwight Hey Michael, how was your date last night?

17340 Angela It's ridiculous.
17341 Dwight I do, I have to go.

17344 Ryan My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?
17345 Dwight No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?

17348 Ryan Love it. Go.
17349 Dwight Uh huh. [to Ryan and Michael] I'm not gonna call her.

17372 Ryan I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.
17373 Dwight Wow.
17374 Dwight Question.
17375 Michael This is it.
17376 Ryan Dwight.
17377 Dwight All right.
17378 Dwight Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
17379 Michael This is where the magic happens.
17380 Ryan This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.
17381 Dwight Nice.

17386 Stanley When will that be?
17387 Dwight I got sofa. I got sofa.

17390 Phyllis Did the police solve the problem with the...
17391 Dwight I got floor.

17394 Ryan Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
17395 Dwight [to Ryan] Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
17396 Dwight I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.

17400 Ryan It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election
17401 Dwight It's a lullaby.

17406 Kelly If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.
17407 Dwight I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.

17412 Michael [slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
17413 Dwight OK. Good night Ryan.

17444 Michael Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.
17445 Dwight Yeah!
17446 Andy Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.
17447 Angela I'm right here.
17448 Dwight No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.

17451 Michael I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
17452 Dwight [laughs] With s*x!

17457 Michael Place is packed.
17458 Dwight Fire hazard.

17492 Troy Hey, how ya doing?
17493 Dwight Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
17494 Ryan Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.
17495 Dwight No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.

17499 Michael Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
17500 Dwight Do you live in a regular sized house?

17521 Ryan This guy owns his own beet farm.
17522 Troy Insane.
17523 Dwight Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
17524 Ryan Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?
17525 Dwight They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
17526 Ryan Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.
17527 Dwight You've already been several times.
17528 Ryan Yeah.
17529 Dwight Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
17530 Ryan I don't know, maybe.
17531 Dwight I'll order you some cranberry juice.
17532 Ryan With vodka, you're the best.
17533 Dwight [to troy] Do you have powers?

17560 Ryan [to bouncer] Check again, Ryan Howard.
17561 Dwight [to tall woman in front of him, tapping her shoulder] Excuse me.
17562 Tall Girl #1 Yeah?
17563 Dwight [referring to girls in front of him] How did you all find each other?
17564 Tall Girl #1 Uh, we're the Jersey State Varsity Basketball team. Northeast Regional Champs.

17566 Dwight Amazons.

17569 Ryan Let's bail. [starts to leave]

17571 Tall Girl #2 We're not going unless we can all go.
17572 Dwight OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him [referring to Troy]. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.

17579 Bartender There you go.
17580 Dwight Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
17581 Bartender It's for you. From them. [points to Jersey State girls across the bar]
17582 Dwight Oh. [dumps drink out]
17583 Troy What are you doing man?
17584 Dwight It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. [to girls] Nice try.

17643 Michael I... love it!! Haha, come on!
17644 Dwight Come on! [Kevin and Dwight laugh and follow Michael]

17647 Jim Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
17648 Dwight Can you breathe?
17649 Jim Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
17650 Dwight Hold your breath.
17651 Jim And in this case...
17652 Dwight Ready?
17653 Jim That's also not true.
17654 Dwight And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.

17663 Andy What about a cat eating man food?
17664 Dwight Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.

17706 Andy You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.
17707 Dwight [kicks the car] Unh! Scratch.
17708 Andy That's a racing stripe.
17709 Dwight Uh, bumper's sagging.
17710 Andy Mmm, I doubt that very much.
17711 Dwight This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
17712 Andy How next to?
17713 Dwight Well, here are your options[/b]
17714 Andy I have to pick one of those?
17715 Dwight Yes.
17716 Andy Can you go over those options again?
17717 Dwight You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
17718 Andy Well I have the, the blue book value...
17719 Dwight Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
17720 Andy Can I think about it?
17721 Dwight Five, four, three, two...
17722 Andy Let me think about it--
17723 Dwight Now. Now. Now.
17724 Andy Let me think about it--
17725 Dwight Say it. Do it. Now.
17726 Andy I'm thinking about it--
17727 Dwight Do it now.
17728 Andy Thinking--
17729 Dwight Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.

17736 Stanley It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.
17737 Dwight Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
17738 Michael Uh huh...
17739 Dwight There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
17740 Michael Great
17741 Dwight However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
17742 Michael What's the pink?
17743 Dwight Menstrual cycles.
17744 Michael Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
17745 Dwight You.
17746 Michael Other than me.
17747 Dwight Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
17748 Michael I never said you could do that.
17749 Dwight All you have to do it say it.
17750 Michael I...
17751 Dwight Just say it.
17752 Michael Okay, I will think about it.
17753 Dwight Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
17754 Michael No.
17755 Dwight So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.

17807 Jim Yeah...
17808 Dwight [washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
17809 Andy What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit.
17810 Dwight It's my car now.
17811 Andy I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.
17812 Dwight Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
17813 Dwight I've got a Madlib for you[/b]

17864 Michael Like you're applying for a loan.
17865 Dwight Maybe he's going to church. Or court.

17898 Creed Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!
17899 Dwight Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? [Stanley gets up to go] Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
17900 Phyllis What consequences?
17901 Dwight I will tell on you.

17933 Michael Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline!
17934 Dwight Thank you. [hangs up phone, leaves for restroom]

17941 Michael [answers cell] What do you want?
17942 Dwight Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
17943 Michael Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
17944 Dwight So... what else is up? [Michael hangs up] Mich-

17970 Andy Shortcut! Shortcut! [drives cart off course, it flips over] Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!
17971 Dwight [hums at copier, Angela waiting behind him]

17994 Andy [trying to pick up a beer bottle with blistered hands, struggles trying to take a drink as everyone watches.]
17995 Dwight [tries to stop a sneeze] Ah-choo!
17996 Angela Bless you.
17997 Dwight Thank you. [Angela turns to look at him.]

18011 Angela [Dwight and Angela exiting, he opens door for her] Thank you.
18012 Dwight You're welcome.

18042 Pam Thanks.
18043 Dwight [cell phone rings] Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. [phone keeps ringing] Hello?

18046 Holly Okay.
18047 Dwight Hello? Hello?

18051 Holly Oh that would be great.
18052 Dwight Jim, what are you doing?

18057 Holly I love pie.
18058 Dwight Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-

18063 Holly Okay.
18064 Dwight [into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!

18069 Holly Okay. Good night.
18070 Dwight [cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.

18087 Toby It's not.
18088 Dwight Woah, woah, woah, Pam!

18093 Hank I don't think he's gonna take anything.
18094 Dwight Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.

18099 Toby [watch that Michael gave him beeps] Oh, some kind of... alarm.
18100 Dwight No! [waves arms] Pam, I'm over here!

18105 Michael [on phone, leaving a message] Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning. [hangs up] I am going to be... kind of a daddy.
18106 Dwight Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.

18111 Angela [sees Phyllis
18112 Dwight Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. [presses buttons on his cell phone] Done.
18113 Michael Okay.
18114 Dwight What? [turns and sees Phyllis

18120 Pam Okay.
18121 Dwight [slams cell phone on desk] Argh! Ahh!!

18165 Michael I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.
18166 Dwight You did.

18169 Angela No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.
18170 Dwight You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face]

18199 Pam I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.
18200 Dwight Oh my gosh.

18205 Jim It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
18206 Dwight Yes.

18222 Holly What's protocol on this?
18223 Dwight So what do we know about her?

18226 Holly Michael, are you okay?
18227 Dwight I hate her too.

18230 Holly Oh, of course you are.
18231 Dwight Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.

18234 Holly No, hey.
18235 Dwight Would that be such a bad thing?

18238 Holly Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...
18239 Dwight What?

18242 Kevin [everyone exits the building to find a carnival-themed party in the parking lot] Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!
18243 Dwight But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]

18265 Michael Oh, hey, do you still work here?
18266 Dwight You have it?

18269 Michael Nah.
18270 Dwight Okay, here we go. Here we go. [Mose carries a raccoon in a cage] Put it in. [he puts the raccoon in the car]

18277 Holly Hi.
18278 Dwight [Mose drops cage and runs] Mose!

18281 Holly Man, someone doesn't like H.R.
18282 Dwight N-nothing you need to know the details of.

18285 Holly [to Toby] What did you do to him?
18286 Dwight N-no there's not.

18289 Michael T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
18290 Dwight It was playful hazing.

18293 Michael Y-You can-Michael.
18294 Dwight It's not rabid.

18299 Holly Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.
18300 Dwight Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.

18308 Holly I just... Um, excuse me.
18309 Dwight [whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?

18312 Vance Refrigeration guy Hey Mrs. Vance, we're all out!
18313 Dwight He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.

18316 Holly Cool! You drive your own car?
18317 Dwight Yeah.
18318 Kevin Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?
18319 Dwight Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
18320 Holly Yep. Just like you.
18321 Dwight Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]

18515 Michael Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
18516 Dwight Well... it's my own fault.

18561 Holly Yeah.
18562 Dwight From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.

18569 Michael Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.
18570 Dwight What are you smiling about there smiley pants? You're late.
18571 Dwight No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
18572 Dwight Party's over. You are so busted!

18579 Michael OK.
18580 Dwight [sprays food with bug poison] There. Take those home to your wife.

18585 Meredith Nothing.
18586 Dwight Michael, it's time.
18587 Michael You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
18588 Dwight Dripping on me.
18589 Dwight Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
18590 Dwight Happy Birthday, Stanley! [kicks cake onto Michael]

18605 Kelly I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico.
18606 Dwight Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.

18611 Michael Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him.
18612 Dwight Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.

18615 Michael I did!
18616 Dwight Family only.

18675 Jim Mmm.
18676 Dwight [forces candy out of vending machine and forces fruit into racks]
18677 Michael I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man!
18678 Oscar Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.
18679 Dwight Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left. [looking at Phyllis] And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.

18682 Oscar Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.
18683 Dwight I am hardly the problem, Jim.

18686 Oscar I'm gay!
18687 Dwight This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.

18706 Pam Yes.
18707 Dwight Hello Phyllis. Do you have a minute? Listen. I'm really sorry... about what I said before. Ok? I was way out of line.

18710 Pam Yes.
18711 Dwight But you know what, I want to make it up to you. There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job. Interested?

18714 Pam I have everything.
18715 Dwight [sighs] Sixty - forty. Hm? [they shake hands] I'll drive.
18716 Pam Tomorrow I start a three-month design program at the Pratt Institute in New York. I will be a little fish in the big apple. [does hand gesture] What up, 212?
18717 Ryan [exhales, camera shows Kelly and Darryl making out on the reception couch, Kelly looking at Ryan]
18718 Dwight Fax this for me.

18721 Michael Mmm-hmm. Saunas.
18722 Dwight It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. [to Pam] If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.

18739 Pam Wow, was it the age difference?
18740 Dwight [exiting warehouse storage room] Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.

18743 Pam Hey! Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends!
18744 Dwight Monkey. [kisses her]
18745 Phyllis [storms in the office, sweaty and out of breath] Are you insane?!
18746 Angela No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!
18747 Dwight Hey, hey!

18752 Michael [frazzled and out of breath] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
18753 Dwight And you burned over a thousand calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen! [claps]

18756 Michael No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls."
18757 Dwight Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about? [Phyllis storms to her desk, picks up phone and dials] You look great. I can definitely see the difference.

18788 Jim I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.
18789 Dwight No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"

18792 Holly Wikka wikka wikka what?
18793 Dwight Vamping.

18796 Jim I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.
18797 Dwight Eh, I've been sitting all day.

18818 Kevin Hi Jan.
18819 Dwight She should thank me.

18826 Kevin Cool. Thank God they found her, too.
18827 Dwight [exhales] I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.

18873 Michael Hey!
18874 Dwight Let's do this thing.
18875 Darryl I say we have a parade.
18876 Angela [Dwight slaps her butt] Hey!
18877 Dwight We better.

18886 Pam This is so cool.
18887 Dwight Yes, you do.

18890 Pam Lunch with a girl from my hall.
18891 Dwight I do not! I do not say "Hi" Pam!

18895 Pam I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?
18896 Dwight OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.

18908 Pam They're on the supply shelf.
18909 Dwight What are you writing about me?

18914 Michael OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts.
18915 Dwight I'm gonna write you both up for not working.

18918 Michael Damn it. Come on.
18919 Dwight Ok, well played. Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.

18923 JIM9334 The rest stop where that soda exploded on me. Exit 17, I think. 1 o'clock.
18924 Dwight Come on, Bernard. [Andy spits on floor as warehouse worker walks past]

18927 Jim [holds up an ASCII image of Dwight]
18928 Dwight All right, we're set.

18957 Andy Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight. [turns up thermostat] It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.
18958 Dwight Shotgun weddings.

18967 Jim Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
18968 Dwight Obesity-caused illnesses.

18972 Jim I would like to lose 65 pounds.
18973 Dwight [sprays the inside of the vending machine with bug spray]

19028 Phyllis Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.
19029 Dwight God. Where is Jim?

19035 Holly Yeah.
19036 Dwight Michael, we have a situation.
19037 Michael I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
19038 Dwight They should not be in that room.

19043 Holly Aww man, I really wanted to see them.
19044 Dwight Yeah!

19055 Holly Michael, you don't have to buy them.
19056 Dwight Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.

19084 Jim To get married.
19085 Dwight [raises hand] She's not a virgin, you know.

19094 Holly Today is ethics day. After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here. It's gonna be insaaaaane. No, it's not. I have to read from the binder.
19095 Dwight [trying to assist Michael, who is trying to press play on a CD player] I got it, I got it. [Olivia Newton-John's "Let's Get Physical" starts to play as Holly and Michael jog into the meeting room, dancing]

19113 Andy Hey-oh!
19114 Dwight Yes.

19121 Michael Yeah.
19122 Dwight What should we be working on while you guys are talking?

19134 Andy Yeah, I took intro to philosophy, twice. No big deal.
19135 Dwight It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.

19147 Michael A siesta!
19148 Dwight Time thief. Time thief! Fire him!
19149 Jim Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
19150 Dwight Never!

19182 Jim [starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn. Four seconds.
19183 Dwight What are you doing?
19184 Jim Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
19185 Dwight Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]
19186 Jim Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds.
19187 Dwight There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch]

19214 Jim Actually not. It was really so-so.
19215 Dwight Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]

19241 Jim [Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?
19242 Dwight None of your business.
19243 Jim So I guess I can assume that was personal.
19244 Dwight [Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.
19245 Jim So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
19246 Dwight Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]

19285 Stanley Amen. Just keep the ribs coming.
19286 Dwight [looking pregnant] Hey Michael?

19289 Jan Thanks for the baby shower. It was great. And I'll see you... soon.
19290 Dwight Contractions are coming every ten minutes.

19293 Jan OK.
19294 Dwight My cervix is ripening.

19299 Holly Yes.
19300 Dwight Michael! My water's breaking!

19303 Jim [on voicemail] Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message.
19304 Dwight Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?

19307 Pam [on voicemail, because she's calling Jim at the same time] Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message.
19308 Dwight Right. Highways or surface roads?

19311 Pam I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...
19312 Dwight No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt!

19315 Pam I'll leave a message.
19316 Dwight It's about adapting to the circumstances.

19321 Jim Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
19322 Dwight No. OK, no. I'm crowning! I'm crowning! Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]

19325 Jim Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
19326 Dwight The pressure! The pressure!

19329 Jim Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe.
19330 Dwight Aaaaaaaa!

19333 Jim Wish you were home. Uh, anyway...
19334 Dwight Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.

19337 Jim I miss you.
19338 Dwight [lying on Michael's desk] Hold me!
19339 Michael I'm right here.
19340 Dwight Cradle my head!
19341 Michael I'm right here, I'm right here.
19342 Dwight I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
19343 Michael [annoyed] All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.
19344 Dwight Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
19345 Michael Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late.
19346 Dwight No! I don't want natural!
19347 Michael No. You have to just push it out!
19348 Dwight OK!
19349 Michael Keep simulating.
19350 Dwight Aaaaaaaa!
19351 Michael OK!
19352 Dwight Do you have the Sharpie?!
19353 Michael Keep simulating.
19354 Dwight Do you have the Sharpie?!
19355 Michael Yes, I do!
19356 Dwight OK! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
19357 Michael OK.
19358 Dwight Ready?!
19359 Michael Yes.
19360 Dwight Aaaaaaaa!
19361 Michael Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go! [drops the watermelon onto the floor] Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
19362 Dwight Butter. Newborns are slippery.

19403 Jim OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. [hangs up] That was a good story.
19404 Dwight Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?

19427 Jim Really...
19428 Dwight Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby]
19429 Dwight Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's.

19467 Oscar She's got an Orbit
19468 Dwight Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
19469 Michael OK, what else?
19470 Dwight Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]

19482 Jan [now belting out the lyrics, even though Astrid is asleep] How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...
19483 Dwight [heaving the stroller into a tire yard] Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child!
19484 Dwight [throwing the stroller against a high chain link fence] Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
19485 Dwight [tossing the stroller off a tall heap of tires] Playtime is over!

19545 Jan Uh... come on.
19546 Dwight I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times]

19550 Jan You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?
19551 Dwight Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.

19562 Pam Hey.
19563 Dwight 350 and one penny.

19570 Michael [on phone] Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
19571 Dwight 400 and one penny.

19578 Holly Yeah, it was nice.
19579 Dwight 500 and one penny.

19586 Holly Yeah.
19587 Dwight 700 and one penny.

19592 Michael Well...
19593 Dwight Eh, it's not worth it.

19618 Andy That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.
19619 Dwight [whispering] You set a date?
19620 Andy J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.
19621 Phyllis [sigh] What are you making?
19622 Dwight A knife.
19623 Phyllis You're making a knife with a knife?
19624 Dwight You got a better way?
19625 Phyllis You want to talk about it?
19626 Dwight About what?
19627 Phyllis You know I know. [looks at the camera guys] You know they know.
19628 Dwight I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.

19637 Phyllis Hi.
19638 Dwight She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
19639 Phyllis It's nice to learn new things.
19640 Dwight I was talking to myself.
19641 Phyllis Okay.
19642 Dwight I just don't get it.
19643 Phyllis What don't you get?
19644 Dwight Why is she marrying Andy?
19645 Phyllis Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.
19646 Dwight That's really fattening.

19667 Jim We were robbed last night.
19668 Dwight Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.

19691 Andy [cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home!
19692 Dwight [Dwight groans] Ugh.
19693 Dwight Get in.
19694 Phyllis Where are we going?
19695 Dwight I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
19696 Phyllis Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.
19697 Dwight Are you sure that's going to work?
19698 Phyllis It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.
19699 Dwight Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...

19723 Holly Mm-hmm.
19724 Dwight Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]
19725 Angela I think you have me confused with another person.
19726 Dwight I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6

19770 Guy in audience 140.
19771 Dwight Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.

19775 Michael 160.
19776 Dwight I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires]
19777 Phyllis Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?
19778 Dwight Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
19779 Phyllis Now you move on.
19780 Dwight Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
19781 Phyllis Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.
19782 Dwight Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
19783 Phyllis Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.
19784 Dwight Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.
19785 Dwight What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany]

19820 Michael 300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice.
19821 Dwight 300 and one penny.

19824 Kelly [dressed as Carrie Bradshaw] Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.
19825 Dwight Will end completely!

19828 Kelly Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from s*x And The City.
19829 Dwight [has won the table war] That is all sir, you may go.

19871 Darryl [bluesy] Da na na na na... da na na na na...
19872 Dwight [dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.

19909 Michael [deeper] Da na na na na.
19910 Dwight Good morning temp.

19913 Michael [blues singer] Da na na na na...
19914 Dwight Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you Phyllis?
19915 Andy [Whistling, enters office in farmer overalls] I thought I'd come in casual today. Man, I'm hungry. Anyone else feel like a beet?
19916 Andy Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy.
19917 Dwight Where did you get those?
19918 Dwight Andy.
19919 Andy What, these? Bernard Farms. Best beets in the state.
19920 Andy Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.
19921 Dwight I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
19922 Dwight No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
19923 Andy Well you will. Soon as you visit, my new beet farm. [attempts to bite into a raw beet, beet is too hard] You're supposed to cook these, aren't you?
19924 Andy Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?
19925 Dwight [scoffs] Cornell. [easily bites into a beet]
19926 Dwight Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
19927 Phyllis I'm sitting right here Dwight.
19928 Dwight I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
19929 Dwight Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]

19935 Michael, Holly, and Darryl If you're going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you're going my way...
19936 Dwight Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
19937 Andy Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.
19938 Dwight Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
19939 Andy I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.
19940 Dwight Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.

20004 Andy Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling]
20005 Dwight Excuse me?

20010 Andy It's pronounced "Corn-ell!" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!
20011 Dwight Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
20012 Andy Fine.
20013 Dwight What do you say?

20054 Andy Dwight!
20055 Dwight Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
20056 Andy Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.
20057 Dwight That's a conflict of interest.
20058 Andy Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?
20059 Dwight [thinks] Interview.
20060 Andy Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.
20061 Dwight What?
20062 Andy The conference room!
20063 Dwight Okay.

20094 Andy Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.
20095 Dwight Bring it.
20096 Andy Who was Cornell's eighth president?
20097 Dwight Dale Raymond Corson!
20098 Andy Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. [writes in a notebook] Comprehension skills, sub-par.
20099 Dwight Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par. [writes in a notebook]
20100 Andy What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?
20101 Dwight On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
20102 Andy Nobody wants ...that, to happen.
20103 Dwight Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
20104 Andy "Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character."
20105 Dwight "Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process."
20106 Andy "Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations."
20107 Dwight "Interviewer has suspect motives."
20108 Andy "Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid."
20109 Dwight "Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth." Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
20110 Andy I have everything I need- [talking over each other]
20111 Dwight And you will be hearing from the -
20112 Andy And you will be hearing from -
20113 Dwight -Cornell Application Department,
20114 Andy which I will not be a part of-
20115 Dwight And you will not be pleased with the result. [pulls table away from Andy]
20116 Andy And YOU will not be pleased with the result!
20117 Dwight And your affiliation with Cornell -

20120 Jim Easy.
20121 Dwight I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh? [punches Michael's shoulder]
20122 Dwight OK.
20123 Michael Ow! God!
20124 Jim Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
20125 Dwight Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
20126 Kelly You just can't come into my nook and call me stupid. And maybe if you were a little bit more nice and polite, then people wouldn't give you such bad customer reviews.
20127 Darryl I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.
20128 Dwight The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.

20197 Jim [on Bluetooth] Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
20198 Dwight No. [holds Sheriff's Department mug protectively]

20201 Alex Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee?
20202 Dwight No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut]

20205 Pam I should go.
20206 Dwight Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
20207 Michael Alrighty, Dwighty, let's see how you did.
20208 Jim Probably just Kelly.
20209 Dwight Bring it on. [starts to put foot up on Michael's desk]
20210 Dwight Obviously. I knew it.
20211 Michael No.
20212 Jim That's what I'm saying.
20213 Dwight Sorry.
20214 Dwight Yeah. What?
20215 Michael Wow.
20216 Jim You were right.
20217 Dwight What does it say?
20218 Dwight I was -- I was right.
20219 Michael Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
20220 Jim You were right.
20221 Dwight That's impossible.
20222 Dwight I was right.
20223 Michael A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
20224 Jim You knew it.
20225 Dwight I sell more paper than anyone. [stands and reaches for the file]
20226 Dwight I knew it.
20227 Michael No, no, no, no, no.
20228 Jim You knew it the whole time, buddy.
20229 Dwight Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
20230 Dwight I knew it the whole time, buddy! [shoves Jim]
20231 Michael Do I look like I am joking?
20232 Jim Wow.
20233 Dwight No, but that's sometimes part of it.
20234 Dwight Yeah! Woo-hoo!
20235 Michael If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
20236 Pam [in New York] Right Dwight is loud.
20237 Dwight Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
20238 Dwight I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head

20247 Pam [listening in New York] I miss him.
20248 Dwight Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.

20253 Jim Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
20254 Dwight Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.

20269 Andy Dude, that is my face!
20270 Dwight We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone]

20278 Kelly I was lying.
20279 Dwight What are you mumbling about?
20280 Michael Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
20281 Jim How was your meeting with Michael?
20282 Dwight I want to be here when you fire her ass.
20283 Dwight None of your business.

20286 Michael I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
20287 Dwight Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --

20290 Michael I think you should do that. [Kelly starts fake-crying, then laughing, then she and Michael both laugh]
20291 Dwight I'm being sabotaged.

20294 Pam Hey, what are you doing here?
20295 Dwight And I'm going to find that person and punish them.

20298 Pam It's Alex.
20299 Dwight You're an idiot.

20306 Alex Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it?
20307 Dwight No way.

20312 Alex [in private office] Um.
20313 Dwight I didn't say anything

20318 Pam Wow.
20319 Dwight What do you think I am saying to you?!

20322 Alex Why did you come to New York in the first place?
20323 Dwight I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.

20335 Michael You too?
20336 Dwight Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? [reaches toward Jim's ear] May I?

20339 Michael Jim, they are a poopy. [Jim coughs, presses button to end call on Bluetooth]
20340 Dwight Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.

20343 Jim Are we even sure that's my file?
20344 Dwight Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials? [opens album]

20347 Jim Well, there's got to be an explanation.
20348 Dwight [looking at Angela] While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. [Angela smiles] I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. [Andy moves his head into Dwight's view] Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.

20351 Jim Yeah.
20352 Dwight While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.

20355 Jim I think you mean smug
20356 Dwight OK.

20359 Jim Michael, I'm just trying to --
20360 Dwight You already said deal.

20369 Michael Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
20370 Dwight All right, fine. [picks up phone] Brrring.
20371 Jim [picks up phone] Hello?
20372 Dwight Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
20373 Jim Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
20374 Dwight Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
20375 Jim Wow, this is my lucky day.
20376 Michael [whispers] Ask him his name.
20377 Dwight What is your name, sir?
20378 Jim I am Bill Buttlicker.
20379 Dwight Really, that's your real name?
20380 Jim How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
20381 Michael Be respectful, Dwight.
20382 Dwight Yes, Michael.
20383 Jim Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
20384 Dwight What? No, but I --

20387 Jim Sorry. That was a family emergency.
20388 Dwight Oh, no. What's wrong?
20389 Jim You know what? That's private.
20390 Michael Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
20391 Dwight Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
20392 Jim Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
20393 Michael He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
20394 Dwight OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
20395 Jim You're gonna have to talk louder.
20396 Dwight OK, our prices have never been lower.
20397 Jim Son, you have to talk louder.
20398 Dwight ...never been lower!
20399 Jim Louder, son!
20400 Dwight [shouting] Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
20401 Michael Stop it! Stop it!
20402 Dwight He --

20407 Michael Give me the phone.
20408 Dwight Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
20409 Jim I'm irate right now.
20410 Michael Give me the phone.
20411 Dwight Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
20412 Michael Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
20413 Dwight I have to put you on with my boss.

20418 Jim Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
20419 Dwight [shakes fist, whispers] Yeah!
20420 Michael [covers phone, whispers to Dwight] See how it's done? [into phone] Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. [to Dwight] See what I did?
20421 Dwight You are the master.

20424 Jim You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
20425 Dwight Don't do it, Michael.

20438 Jim Dwight. Dwight. [Dwight's car comes screeching into view]
20439 Dwight Get in!
20440 Jim Are you serious?
20441 Dwight Get in! [he peels off into parking space]
20442 Jim OK, what are you --
20443 Dwight Shh. [turns radio up loud, playing "Centerfold."] They might be listening to us.
20444 Jim What's that?
20445 Dwight They might be listening to us

20448 Jim In this car?
20449 Dwight You never know. Better safe than sorry.
20450 Jim [turns radio down] What are you thinking?
20451 Dwight Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
20452 Jim The mob, maybe NASA.
20453 Dwight Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.

20456 Jim How many shoes do you need?
20457 Dwight I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
20458 Jim I'm not talking to you.
20459 Dwight Who are you talking to?
20460 Jim Pam.
20461 Dwight She's not here, Jim.

20466 Customer [on phone] So I'd like to redouble my order, if you could put me down for, um --
20467 Dwight Wait, shut up.
20468 Customer I'm sorry?
20469 Dwight Shh. Do you hear that?
20470 Customer Hear what?
20471 Dwight Breathing. Is that you?
20472 Customer Well, I am breathing, yes.
20473 Dwight Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on. [puts down phone and runs away]
20474 Customer I need paper.
20475 Dwight [jumps into Kelly's area] Ha! [Kelly screams in surprise]
20476 Kelly Oh, my God. You scared me.
20477 Dwight Hear anything interesting?
20478 Kelly What are you talking about?
20479 Dwight [laughs] I think you know.
20480 Kelly You always say that, and I almost never know.
20481 Dwight What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
20482 Kelly Are you accusing me of something?
20483 Dwight Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
20484 Jim [behind Dwight][/b]
20485 Dwight [surprised] Ah!

20547 Andy Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar]
20548 Dwight Wait, why do you need three suitcases?

20551 Andy She's taking us back to first base.
20552 Dwight Do you have your money belt?

20555 Andy I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.
20556 Dwight No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra. [demonstrates]

20559 Andy Wingman for life. W.M.F.L
20560 Dwight Here, let me help you. [reaches for Michael's money belt]

20563 Andy You up for a chest bump?
20564 Dwight Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.

20595 David Wallace I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.
20596 Dwight [sighs and picks up Michael's empty suitcases]

20624 Michael Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
20625 Dwight You're back.

20628 Michael Yes...
20629 Dwight Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers]

20632 Michael Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums.
20633 Dwight Alright. First thing in the morning then.

20777 Angela What?
20778 Dwight [over phone] Who is that monkey?

20789 Jim [noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?
20790 Dwight Know what?
20791 Meredith Pam failed art school.
20792 Dwight Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.
20793 Jim Excuse me?
20794 Dwight Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
20795 Phyllis Dwight, stop it.
20796 Stanley Dwight.
20797 Dwight What? Are there two suns?
20798 Meredith Come on.
20799 Stanley Oh my God.
20800 Dwight Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
20801 Jim I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
20802 Dwight It's totally unrealistic. There are no lines in the parking lot.

20814 Michael Are you kidding me? That's my salad.
20815 Dwight Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
20816 Dwight So wait a minute, there's no drugs?
20817 Jim So why did you come in here?
20818 Police Officer 2 No.
20819 Dwight To socialize. And inform.
20820 Dwight Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!

20823 Ryan You're taking two?
20824 Dwight Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?

20827 Michael Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
20828 Dwight [following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them?

20862 Ryan It's not fair to you. And it's really not fair to me.
20863 Dwight He looks great.

20866 Ryan That was your choice
20867 Dwight Well rested.

20890 Jim I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside. [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall] Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood. [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]
20891 Dwight Also, it's icky back there.

20917 Michael [Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael's shoulders] Don't do that.
20918 Dwight What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting[/b]

20964 Michael Okay, just summarize.
20965 Dwight Okay, fireable offenses include[/b]
20966 Michael That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
20967 Dwight I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors.
20968 Michael Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started.
20969 Dwight Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie]
20970 Michael What are you doing?
20971 Dwight [removes glasses] I am the bait.
20972 Michael For what?
20973 Dwight Men find me desirable.
20974 Michael No, no, no.
20975 Dwight Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
20976 Michael You're the bait for Toby?
20977 Dwight Mmhmm.
20978 Michael No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me.
20979 Dwight Men find me desirable.

21004 Michael Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?
21005 Dwight Those are fighting words.
21006 Michael You mad? You mad at me?
21007 Dwight I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
21008 Michael Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
21009 Dwight Hmmm?

21012 Michael I dare you to. Come on.
21013 Dwight Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah!
21014 Michael What's the matter... haaaww!
21015 Dwight Hit him! Hit him, Chicken.
21016 Ryan Yeah, punch him.
21017 Michael Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?
21018 Dwight Ryan. Come on, man?
21019 Michael No do it, do it. I dare you.
21020 Dwight Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
21021 Michael Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon...
21022 Toby I'm not going to punch you, Michael.
21023 Dwight Are you really not going to punch him?

21026 Ryan [as Toby picks up his photos] You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man.
21027 Dwight I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
21028 Michael [mouth full of brownie] Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.
21029 Dwight There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
21030 Michael What's that?
21031 Dwight [goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.
21032 Michael Frame him?
21033 Dwight Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
21034 Michael I've never framed a man before, have you?
21035 Dwight Oh I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.

21064 Michael Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot...
21065 Dwight [on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin. His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America. I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is Andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon.

21069 Pam Here?
21070 Dwight Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay? Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office. [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]
21071 Creed Just pretend like we're talking until the cops leave.
21072 Michael Those are real cops, real guns. I wonder what's going on. [follows them]
21073 Dwight Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
21074 Toby Hey, what is this?
21075 Dwight Search his things.

21079 Toby Hey, what's going on? You don't have my permission to do this.
21080 Dwight They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.

21085 Toby I have a reasonable right to privacy.
21086 Dwight Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.

21104 Michael Ahh, that's mine.
21105 Dwight No! Michael, no!

21111 Michael Mmm... okay.
21112 Dwight Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt

21115 Michael Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
21116 Dwight Yes, of course it does.

21119 Michael Yes.
21120 Dwight It does in the state of Pennsylvania.

21123 Michael There's the x-ax...icks.
21124 Dwight Haha, Mrs. Schrute.

21127 Michael Mmhmm, okay.
21128 Dwight Wha...

21131 Michael Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
21132 Dwight My... It's not my fault you don't understand German

21216 Pam Or chairs?
21217 Dwight Yeah, do tell.

21220 Stanley I didn't hear a phone.
21221 Dwight Mmhmm.

21224 Michael No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.
21225 Dwight How could it be more clear?

21228 Angela [kisses Andy passionately in his chair] Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.
21229 Dwight Okay.

21232 Pam So what's it gonna be?
21233 Dwight We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.

21236 Pam Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.
21237 Dwight Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.

21267 Jim [shudders] Whew.
21268 Dwight This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
21269 Andy Hmm... mm, what's that smell?
21270 Dwight You're gonna need to be more specific.
21271 Angela Manure. Get rid of it.
21272 Dwight Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
21273 Angela Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?
21274 Dwight You wanna eat, don't you?
21275 Angela Honey, say something!
21276 Andy Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?
21277 Dwight ...I'll consider it.
21278 Andy See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.
21279 Dwight There's a hose out back.

21351 Michael [laughs] Hahaha!... well...
21352 Dwight Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
21353 Angela No. I haven't thought of it.
21354 Dwight Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
21355 Angela I would like cat.
21356 Dwight Cats don't make butter.
21357 Angela I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.
21358 Dwight It doesn't make any sense.

21361 Angela I want a butter sculpture of a cat!
21362 Dwight Cow, goat or sheep.

21387 Michael Oh... ah, I almost choked.
21388 Dwight Here's another place.
21389 Angela It's beautiful.
21390 Andy Hey-o!
21391 Dwight So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.

21395 Angela I work with Dwight.
21396 Dwight He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
21397 Andy What?
21398 Dwight Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister
21399 Angela I do.
21400 Dwight And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.

21430 Angela Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.
21431 Dwight I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
21432 Dwight What is this?
21433 Jim Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
21434 Dwight You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours?
21435 Jim Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
21436 Dwight Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs] Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
21437 Jim I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
21438 Dwight Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]

21454 Jim Ah. You brought in your doll collection.
21455 Dwight These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil.
21456 Dwight Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season. This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn. Catchphrase
21457 Jim That's the Christmas spirit.
21458 Dwight I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has s*x with a unicorn? Man with a horn has s*x with a royal horse?
21459 Jim Yes.
21460 Michael Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out.
21461 Dwight They are now.

21481 Guy buying doll 120, 180... 200.
21482 Dwight All right.
21483 Guy Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this.
21484 Dwight Oh, so glad I could help.
21485 Guy Thanks.
21486 Dwight Merry Christmas.
21487 Guy You too.
21488 Dwight Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
21489 Michael [sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.
21490 Jim [Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!
21491 Dwight We got a live one! On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith]

21520 Michael Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]
21521 Dwight Aye.

21541 Michael Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?
21542 Dwight No, I like Meredith.
21543 Dwight Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.

21559 Michael [amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?
21560 Dwight I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
21561 Dwight There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
21562 Michael Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.
21563 Dwight Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
21564 Michael Dwight--
21565 Dwight She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
21566 Michael [sighs]...okay.
21567 Dwight I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
21568 Jim Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
21569 Dwight Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
21570 Creed I can get you one in an hour.
21571 Dwight Really?

21611 Toby This is great. My ex-wife's going to be so pissed. [chuckles] For once daddy's gonna be a hero.
21612 Dwight $200.
21613 Darryl Yo.
21614 Toby Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.
21615 Dwight Oh, that's my last one.

21618 Toby I was-- I was gonna get the doll.
21619 Dwight Not my problem.

21658 Phyllis Okay. [starts to walk away, then turns around] Angela's having s*x with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.
21659 Dwight Well don't look so surprised.

21672 Pam [answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?
21673 Dwight [shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!

21677 Kelly I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.
21678 Dwight [yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!
21679 Dwight Come on!
21680 Phyllis Wow, thirteen!
21681 Meredith Hey, has anything happened yet?
21682 Dwight Yes!
21683 Dwight Where are you?
21684 Michael No. No, no. There was wind.
21685 Oscar Mm-mm. It's 4
21686 Dwight I was just jogging.
21687 Kevin Oh come on, man! Believe in something.
21688 Michael Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
21689 Dwight Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes

21698 Oscar Thirty-one is humanly impossible.
21699 Dwight [still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...

21706 Michael Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.
21707 Dwight Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!

21712 Pam Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.
21713 Dwight Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!

21716 Pam Yeah.
21717 Dwight Never! [hits Andy's car with his bike chain] Get out and face me like a man!

21720 Pam So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...
21721 Dwight You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] "La la la la la la la la la la!" What does that mean? You can't even protect her!

21724 Michael Wait, you still don't know...
21725 Dwight Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]

21728 Andy Hmm?
21729 Dwight No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.

21734 Jim Why don't... Let's...
21735 Dwight Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]

21738 Jim How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
21739 Dwight I sa- [Andy honks his horn]

21742 Jim Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office]
21743 Dwight Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!

21746 Michael [from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is...
21747 Dwight What?

21750 Michael No, that's not it.
21751 Dwight She's sleeping with you?

21754 Jim Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.
21755 Dwight She said she was only sleeping with me.

21758 Jim We can't figure that out.
21759 Dwight [picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can]
21760 Michael I can't take it anymore.
21761 Andy Thank you. [hangs up]
21762 Dwight Wait, what? You can't take what?
21763 Michael Wow, what a day! Haha! I thought I was gong to get chewed out, but, hold on! Here's an attaboy for ya! What? Rollercoaster ride! Rollercoaster! It just goes to show, you leave Scranton, exciting things can happen. [sighs] Ahh!
21764 Michael I am telling Andy.
21765 Dwight [as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow
21766 Dwight No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.

21772 Oscar Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar
21773 Dwight [coolly] Seems like you already know where.

21781 Andy [on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...
21782 Dwight [whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.
21783 Jim No.
21784 Dwight I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
21785 Jim Please stop.
21786 Dwight [grabs a spoon from Jim's coffee cup and checks behind him with it] I need a soup spoon.
21787 Dwight Rule 17[/b]
21788 Dwight [moves his bobblehead from one side of his nameplate to the other and clears his throat to get Angela's attention]
21789 Angela What is it?
21790 Dwight You've got to tell Andy about us.
21791 Angela That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.
21792 Dwight Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
21793 Angela You're expanding on your worst idea.
21794 Dwight Do you love me or not?
21795 Angela I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?
21796 Dwight Because you're engaged to Andy.
21797 Angela [sighs]
21798 Michael Well?
21799 Dwight Not yet.

21808 Jim This is really not how this is supposed to happen.
21809 Dwight Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
21810 Michael When will she be ready?
21811 Dwight I don't know.
21812 Michael Is she crazy in bed?
21813 Dwight [boastfully] Yes.

21816 Jim Okay, listen.
21817 Dwight Eager.
21818 Jim This shouldn't happen at work.
21819 Dwight And flexible.

21825 Michael I am already walking.
21826 Dwight Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
21827 Michael Okay, what does that mean?
21828 Dwight Might get ugly.
21829 Michael [sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
21830 Jim But you're leaving...
21831 Dwight [to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.

21854 Jim [to Dwight] What are you standing for?
21855 Dwight If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
21856 Jim You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
21857 Dwight If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.

21901 Andy [Dwight enters] Dwight.
21902 Dwight Andy.
21903 Andy It's over.
21904 Dwight Oh good. She broke up with you.
21905 Andy No. It's over between you two.
21906 Dwight Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
21907 Andy You have to.
21908 Dwight No I don't.
21909 Andy [forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.
21910 Dwight [angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
21911 Andy Angela Bernard.
21912 Dwight Will never be her name.
21913 Andy It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!
21914 Dwight I don't think so.
21915 Jim Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
21916 Andy I'm telling you to back down.
21917 Dwight And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
21918 Andy Then I'll make you.
21919 Dwight Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
21920 Andy Through the use of force.
21921 Dwight That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
21922 Andy I will fight you.
21923 Jim Nope.
21924 Dwight Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
21925 Andy Fine!
21926 Dwight Fine!
21927 Oscar This is nuts.
21928 Dwight What is your weapon?
21929 Jim Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...
21930 Dwight Hey, this is none of your business.
21931 Jim Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
21932 Andy Guess what? Not happening at work.
21933 Dwight Yes!
21934 Andy We're gonna do it outside.
21935 Dwight Outside of work.
21936 Andy None of your business.
21937 Dwight None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?
21938 Andy My bare hands.
21939 Dwight That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.

21946 Andy I will be taking my break at 4
21947 Dwight I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
21948 Andy [softly] What a coincidence.
21949 Dwight Mm.
21950 Jim So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.
21951 Jim [collects Dwight's weapons from around the office
21952 Dwight [innocently] How'd that get there?

21962 David [opens his office door] Yeah, finish up.
21963 Dwight What's this?
21964 Dwight Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]
21965 Jim Looks like a red wire.
21966 Michael Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.
21967 Dwight Hmm. It wasn't here before.
21968 Dwight Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]
21969 Jim Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.
21970 Michael Im not a shark.
21971 Dwight Yours doesn't.

21974 Kevin This is ridiculous.
21975 Dwight No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.

21989 Michael Hi, I am well, how are you?
21990 Dwight Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?

22026 Kevin So what do we do now?
22027 Dwight [riding in car with Michael] What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
22028 Michael I will seduce her.
22029 Dwight No, I wanna seduce her.
22030 Michael No, I will seduce her.
22031 Dwight Please Michael, please.
22032 Michael No, I got it.
22033 Dwight You'll fall in love with her.
22034 Michael Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
22035 Dwight Okay, let's go over the plan again.
22036 Michael Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies
22037 Dwight Your fictitious name?
22038 Michael Michael Scarn.
22039 Dwight I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
22040 Michael Okay.
22041 Dwight Then we meet at the Denny's...
22042 Michael [interrupting] No.
22043 Dwight ...and then we compare notes.
22044 Michael No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.
22045 Dwight No! [arguing over each other]
22046 Dwight You know how I feel about IHOP.
22047 Michael Oh, don't start,
22048 Dwight Are you socialist?
22049 Michael You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
22050 Dwight I'll have a cup of a coffee.
22051 Michael You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
22052 Dwight Store only has three employees.
22053 Michael So what?
22054 Dwight It means they are not expanding.
22055 Michael Maybe they are shrinking.
22056 Dwight No.
22057 Michael They could be shrinking.
22058 Dwight No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
22059 Michael Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup.
22060 Dwight [spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
22061 Michael Mm hmm .
22062 Dwight Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
22063 Michael And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
22064 Dwight Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
22065 Michael Argh, why are you all...
22066 Dwight Get your clouds right.
22067 Michael Shut up.
22068 Dwight So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. [Michael licks lips] No, no like this. [Dwight starts and Michael follows passionately licking their lips] Good.
22069 Michael Ready to do this?
22070 Dwight Yeah.

22099 Michael Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
22100 Dwight Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
22101 Prince Grandfather Hi, I'm afraid we're not hiring right now.
22102 Dwight Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son]
22103 Prince Grandfather That's my son.
22104 Dwight I'm your son now
22105 Michael Try 80.
22106 Dwight Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
22107 Prince Grandfather I sure hope not.
22108 Dwight Me too. [smirking]

22118 Prince Grandfather[/b]
22119 Dwight My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]
22120 Michael Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
22121 Dwight It's going very well.

22139 Michael I... Okay, okay, okay, [in disbelief] alright, thank you. [heads towards Dwight, makes make out lips signal]
22140 Dwight [both making make out lips at each other] Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
22141 Michael Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
22142 Dwight Thank you very much.
22143 Michael I cannot wait to contact your clients.
22144 Dwight Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. [hurrying out door]

22147 Michael Haha, we struck the mother load!
22148 Dwight Cmon.
22149 Michael Wallace is going to freak.
22150 Dwight All their top clients I can't believe it.
22151 Michael He's going to absolutely freak.
22152 Dwight Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go. [car hits front divider, screeching]
22153 Michael Oh shoot.
22154 Dwight You drove over that. Go back [car hits divider, screeching]
22155 Michael Oh God, what was that?
22156 Dwight That's not good.
22157 Kelly No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank! [Kelly runs away in tears]
22158 Dwight Oh my God.
22159 Michael Aw, it's alright.
22160 Dwight Oh man,
22161 Michael Aw, my car.
22162 Dwight Not good.
22163 Prince Grandfather Is everyone okay?
22164 Prince Grandmother It sounded bad.
22165 Dwight Yeah.
22166 Michael No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
22167 Dwight You've done more then you can possibly know.

22170 Michael No, no, really not necessary.
22171 Dwight He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..

22175 Oscar See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.
22176 Dwight How much longer is this going to take?

22179 Michael Oh coffee, that's too much. [Dwight drinks it]
22180 Dwight This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?

22184 Prince Grandfather Gosh, well so long. [they exchange byes]
22185 Dwight I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
22186 Michael Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
22187 Dwight Goodbye prince family, [to Michael] should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. [Dwight laughs evilly, Michael seems remorseful] Bye bye.
22188 Dwight [punches Michael on the arm, beckons to Michael for high five, does not get it, high fives himself, smiles contently]

22191 Michael Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
22192 Dwight Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
22193 Michael Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.
22194 Dwight They could do better.
22195 Michael Why don't we just, live and let live?
22196 Dwight What?
22197 Michael Live and let live.
22198 Dwight I'm not familiar with that expression,
22199 Michael It's from James Bond.
22200 Dwight It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
22201 Michael I'm not going to make this call.
22202 Dwight Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
22203 Michael My heart says...
22204 Dwight Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
22205 Michael That is true.
22206 Dwight Yes.
22207 Michael That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
22208 Dwight Yeah.
22209 Michael Jan... Ryan.
22210 Dwight Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
22211 Stanley I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.
22212 Dwight There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
22213 Michael You're right.
22214 Dwight Yeah.
22215 Michael You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
22216 Dwight Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?
22217 Michael Just something I have to do first.
22218 Dwight Where are you taking the client list?
22219 Michael Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]
22220 Dwight Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]
22221 Michael Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around]
22222 Dwight Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]
22223 Dwight No no no, I can't let you do this!
22224 Michael Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door]
22225 Dwight Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher. [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]
22226 Phyllis It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.
22227 Dwight [looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke] Does anyone smell anything smoky?
22228 Dwight Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now!
22229 Angela Did you bring your jerky in again?
22230 Pam Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.
22231 Dwight [clears throat]

22238 Jim Gimme a break.
22239 Dwight Oh, fire! Oh my goodness! What's the procedure? What do we do, people?

22242 Sam [movie] Get that in there. Oh yeah.
22243 Dwight Oh, how did that happen?

22246 Sam I know but if I get it in deeper...
22247 Dwight No, we don't know that. The smoke could be coming through an air duct.

22250 Andy Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?
22251 Dwight What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?

22254 Andy You guys, they're making out.
22255 Dwight Wait, wait, wait.

22258 Jim Hey.
22259 Dwight No! No, Michael! No! Touch the handle. If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.

22264 Pam [sighs]
22265 Dwight Not a viable option.

22268 Pam I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.
22269 Dwight Okay, what's next?

22272 Pam You're good to talk to.
22273 Dwight Oh! Here's a door. Check that one out. How's the handle?

22276 Michael [in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. [Meredtih sits Indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of Michael] Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...
22277 Dwight Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]

22280 Michael [everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.
22281 Dwight Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone. No bunching!

22288 Meredith Chunky monkey.
22289 Dwight Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...

22296 Stanley It's my bio-feedback machine..
22297 Dwight Okay, let's go.

22300 Stanley It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.
22301 Dwight Calm, please

22304 Stanley Yes...
22305 Dwight Have you ever seen a burn victim?

22308 Phyllis Let me get you some water.
22309 Dwight Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?

22312 Stanley No, Michael, No. [beeping speeds up]
22313 Dwight A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people.

22316 Stanley Would ya, would ya step back please
22317 Dwight What's next?

22328 Michael Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer]
22329 Dwight How about 911? Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]

22332 Michael So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.
22333 Dwight Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.

22349 Michael [throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!
22350 Dwight Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
22351 Stanley I'm about to die!
22352 Michael Oh...
22353 Dwight [blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no fire. It was only a simulation.
22354 Dwight Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology]
22355 Jim What?!
22356 Michael Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
22357 Dwight Fire not real. This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor] Oh come on. It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.

22377 David Wallace How could you possibly think this is a good idea?
22378 Dwight May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
22379 Dwight A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
22380 Phyllis Hey, this is your apology letter.
22381 Michael Electricity.
22382 Dwight That was the last signature I needed.
22383 Dwight Shampoo.

22386 Angela If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott. [laughter]
22387 Dwight I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone. Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.

22390 Angela If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...
22391 Dwight Yes I shouted "fire!". I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--

22394 Michael Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
22395 Dwight When no one hedded--

22398 Michael You're so lucky! Good one... [clapping]
22399 Dwight N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.

22402 Michael Well...
22403 Dwight So, you--

22406 Michael Pow pow pow... [hands making gunshot impression, sporadic clapping]
22407 Dwight And, well, I don't see my co-workers--

22410 Michael [Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down]
22411 Dwight Hee-heeding this right now.

22428 Jim Yeah... yep.
22429 Dwight No.
22430 Dwight How dare you all attack him like this.
22431 Michael And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like.
22432 Michael Oh, stop it Dwight.
22433 Dwight PETA.
22434 Dwight Michael is your superior.

22437 Michael Do you?
22438 Dwight Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.

22441 Michael You talking to me?
22442 Dwight Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...

22445 Michael What?
22446 Dwight You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
22447 Dwight Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
22448 Michael Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
22449 Michael [sighs] No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands.
22450 Dwight Are you calling me an idiot?
22451 Dwight Don't you worry about that. I got it covered. Okay?
22452 Michael Idiot.
22453 Michael Yeah.
22454 Dwight Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]
22455 Dwight I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.

22458 Michael Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
22459 Dwight What? You?

22462 Michael Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
22463 Dwight Come on.

22466 Michael We are, we are a family.
22467 Dwight That's preposterous.

22493 Michael Andy.
22494 Dwight It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.

22503 CPR trainer A-B-C. Okay? And hat stands for... airway, breathing and circulation.
22504 Dwight Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
22505 Michael Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing."
22506 Jim Yep. You're being replaced.
22507 Dwight This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
22508 Pam I think he meant personal day.
22509 Michael Shut it. Shut it.
22510 Dwight Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.

22520 Michael [at a park throwing whole pieces of bread] Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...
22521 Dwight Absolutely I would not.

22527 Phyllis That's not a good idea, Michael.
22528 Dwight [after snatching the clipboard with her signature] Got it.

22551 Angela Michael.
22552 Dwight Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?

22585 Rose Yeah, okay. You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.
22586 Dwight Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
22587 Rose I have no idea.
22588 Dwight Anyone else?
22589 Phyllis We bury him?
22590 Dwight Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
22591 Creed He has no wallet, I checked.
22592 Michael He is an organ donor.
22593 Dwight He is.
22594 Michael Yeah.
22595 Dwight Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.

22598 Angela What are you-- [people are yelling] What are you doing?
22599 Dwight We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.

22606 Angela Dwight!
22607 Dwight Clarice?
22608 Stanley Oh my God!
22609 David Wallace Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?
22610 Dwight I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
22611 David Wallace We had to pay for it. Cost us thirty five hundred dollars.
22612 Michael Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
22613 Dwight Wow.

22635 Michael Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?
22636 Dwight I have.
22637 Michael Let's hear it.
22638 Dwight [clears throat] "I state my regret."
22639 Jim You couldn't of memorized that?
22640 Dwight I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it. Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.

22675 Kelly Screw you.
22676 Dwight Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.

22680 Jim [Jim and Dwight sitting next to each other in talking head interview] Go ahead.
22681 Dwight Go ahead, you do it.
22682 Jim Okay.
22683 Dwight I insist.
22684 Jim Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
22685 Dwight What he said was... [puts finger toward Jim's face]
22686 Jim [pushes Dwight's finger away] Just, easy.
22687 Dwight ...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
22688 Jim Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
22689 Dwight [at the same time as Jim] I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. [shoves Jim's arm away] That's on my side.

22713 Kelly Screw you guys. You're dead to me.
22714 Dwight If you say screw you one more time...
22715 Kelly Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.
22716 Dwight Hey, HEY.
22717 Jim [while Dwight and Kelly are arguing] Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
22718 Kelly I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.
22719 Dwight Oh God.
22720 Jim Okay.
22721 Kelly In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.
22722 Dwight What kind of cake do you want imbecile.

22741 Jim [partially blown up balloons on table and hanging from streamers] Are you kidding?
22742 Dwight Well, I'm not done yet.
22743 Jim Dwight. This, [picks up balloon] fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
22744 Dwight They match the carpet
22745 Jim What is that? [looks at sign that says "IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY."] It is your birthday period.
22746 Dwight It's a statement of fact.
22747 Jim Not even an exclamation point?
22748 Dwight This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
22749 Jim I can't believe how bad this looks.
22750 Dwight Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
22751 Jim Okay, good then.
22752 Dwight Have you collected the money from everyone?
22753 Jim I am working on it.
22754 Dwight How much do you have?
22755 Jim Six dollars.
22756 Dwight [yelling] That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
22757 Jim I said I was working on it.
22758 Dwight [sighs]

22852 Andy We lost the account.
22853 Dwight [struggling to blow up a balloon as his desk phone rings] Damn it! [answers phone] Dwight Schrute.
22854 Jim [over the phone] How old's Kelly?
22855 Dwight Who is this?
22856 Jim It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
22857 Dwight Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
22858 Jim Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
22859 Dwight Uh, 24. 37.
22860 Jim Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
22861 Dwight [sighs] I'll call you back. [goes to a filling cabinet takes out a file and looks around]
22862 Dwight I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. [opens file] "Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center." Juvie. "According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..." Blah, Blah, Blah. [closes file]

22879 Michael I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success.
22880 Dwight [opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]

22919 Pam So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! [laughs] [whispers] I've been driving too long.
22920 Dwight [shouts from another room] What did you do?
22921 Kelly Stop yelling at me!
22922 Dwight What did you do?
22923 Kelly I didn't do anything!
22924 Dwight What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
22925 Jim Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
22926 Dwight Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
22927 Kelly I was kickin' it.
22928 Dwight In juvie.
22929 Jim What?
22930 Dwight Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
22931 Jim Yep.
22932 Dwight For reha-
22933 Jim Got it.
22934 Dwight What did you do? Huh?
22935 Jim Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.
22936 Dwight Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. [to Kelly] What did you do?
22937 Kelly My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!
22938 Dwight I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!

22948 Jim Birthday.
22949 Dwight Frosting.
22950 Kelly Those aren't... themes. There's always a theme. [walks out]
22951 Phyllis There's always a theme.
22952 Dwight Nice job on the cake, Bozo!

22998 Jim Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.
22999 Dwight Busy!
23000 Jim Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
23001 Dwight Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
23002 Jim You know what? I could use a little help.
23003 Dwight You know what? I'm a little busy.
23004 Jim We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
23005 Dwight It's not effeminate. It's festive.

23071 Pam [to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.
23072 Dwight [blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.
23073 Jim I'm not writing, "Horse Hunt." I don't even know what that means.
23074 Dwight It's in the name.
23075 Jim [grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
23076 Dwight You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.
23077 Jim Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
23078 Dwight Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]
23079 Jim Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
23080 Dwight Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?
23081 Jim Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
23082 Dwight That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.

23094 Meredith Surprise!
23095 Dwight Hey, it's not a surprise.

23099 Kelly [shakes her head no]
23100 Dwight Told you.

23103 Jim That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
23104 Dwight Our theme, if you will.
23105 Jim Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
23106 Dwight That's our theme.

23109 Kelly I love it.
23110 Dwight [high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
23111 Kevin Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?
23112 Dwight No.

23121 Jim All right.
23122 Dwight Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
23123 Meredith Surprise.
23124 Dwight Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
23125 Jim Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
23126 Kelly [giggles] Thank you.
23127 Dwight [turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]
23128 Kelly I'm too excited to sleep.
23129 Dwight Mm, great cake.

23175 Bob You didn't eat much there Jimbo.
23176 Dwight [running from his desk] Ayyyy!

23200 Jim You're only engaged once. Well present company excluded, but.
23201 Dwight So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.

23204 Jim Yeah. [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away] She's fine.
23205 Dwight OK, what's up?

23208 Michael Oh, wow look at those. How nice for you. Up there, front and center, beautiful. I think they would look better right here. [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side] They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall. [Kevin groans]
23209 Dwight Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this. You know maybe sign--

23212 Michael Pam, really, they're back?
23213 Dwight OK. Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot. God!

23216 Jim They're for her to look at, Michael.
23217 Dwight Thanks, Michael.

23229 Oscar Come on, we'll all go.
23230 Dwight So sexy it becomes hostile.

23245 Michael So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
23246 Dwight Yeah, deal with it Pam!
23247 Michael So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
23248 Dwight Having trouble finding a vein?
23249 Blood Drive Worker Yup, a little.
23250 Dwight How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm]
23251 Dwight I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command. Also, I can retract my pen1s up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]

23359 Michael You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
23360 Dwight You're right. OK everyone, back to work.
23361 Michael No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
23362 Dwight A net? a giant net?
23363 Michael No. Not a giant net.
23364 Dwight What do you have in mind?
23365 Michael I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
23366 Dwight Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
23367 Michael Old fashioned meet market --
23368 Dwight No.
23369 Michael -- I don't think it is.
23370 Dwight Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Pssh. You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
23371 Michael These people need love and I am going to get it for them Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today? A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else. I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say "I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow." Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
23372 Michael Hey.
23373 Dwight Hey. No movement.
23374 Michael Ah, still early.
23375 Dwight Eh, its not that early.
23376 Michael [sighs] So how you holding up?
23377 Dwight I'm ok. Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
23378 Michael No. No, I meant about being single today.
23379 Dwight Oh. Meh.
23380 Michael Meh, exactly. Eh.
23381 Dwight Eh.
23382 Michael Oh, here we go.
23383 Dwight Hello.
23384 Michael Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office. Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead]
23385 Dwight Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde] Hi, Dwight.

23394 Kevin Thank you, Michael.
23395 Dwight I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot, any knot. Go ahead.
23396 Blonde I- I- believe you.
23397 Dwight You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
23398 Blonde Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses.
23399 Dwight You must use a lot of paper.

23414 Michael It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.
23415 Dwight ...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
23416 Michael No reason.
23417 Dwight Is somebody after you?
23418 Oscar Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
23419 Dwight Hey, it just takes one!

23424 Meredith She could be your soul mate.
23425 Dwight Oh, not likely. 3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.

23436 Michael Pam? Knock, knock.
23437 Dwight Alright.

23440 Michael I know you are. Knock, knock.
23441 Dwight OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.

23446 Pam 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
23447 Dwight So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].

23452 Michael Buddha.
23453 Dwight Pam...

23456 Michael [puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]
23457 Dwight That is my idea.

23464 Michael That was helping. It was classic.
23465 Dwight It is my idea.
23466 Dwight I got a knock-knock joke.
23467 Michael Oh how dare you.
23468 Michael No... God.
23469 Dwight It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
23470 Dwight OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
23471 Michael You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
23472 Michael Alright.
23473 Dwight Horse Boat.
23474 Dwight [clears throat] Knock, knock.
23475 Michael Oh please.
23476 Michael Who's there?
23477 Dwight A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
23478 Dwight KGB.
23479 Michael Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
23480 Michael KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face]
23481 Dwight Oh give me a break.
23482 Dwight [in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
23483 Michael ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
23484 Michael What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight]
23485 Dwight That's because they're easy!
23486 Dwight What are you doing?
23487 Michael They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
23488 Michael What are you doing?
23489 Dwight [same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...
23490 Dwight Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
23491 David [same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
23492 Michael You, you like that?
23493 Dwight Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
23494 Dwight C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.

23505 David I am gone.
23506 Dwight I'm not answering it.
23507 Michael When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
23508 Michael Answer the door.
23509 Dwight Oh I am. In my own words.
23510 Jim Ding dong.
23511 Michael I want to see it.
23512 Dwight No way, it's the KGB.
23513 Dwight No.
23514 Jim Ding dong.
23515 Michael I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary]
23516 Dwight I'm not answering that. You answer it.
23517 Dwight No, Michael.
23518 Michael I'm not gonna answer it
23519 Michael Give me... Give me the diary.
23520 Dwight I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
23521 Dwight No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand]
23522 Jim The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
23523 Lynn Hi.
23524 Dwight It's true.

23536 Michael No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
23537 Dwight Ding dong.

23540 Michael I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.
23541 Dwight KGB.

23544 Michael Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
23545 Dwight [in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?

23548 Michael No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
23549 Dwight We have more houses to visit.

23552 Michael No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
23553 Dwight We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4

23556 Andy No! No! No!
23557 Dwight How about 5

23560 Andy [sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'
23561 Dwight Very well, we will come back at 5

23647 Michael [Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
23648 Dwight That was your idea.
23649 Michael Woah, wow, who told you that?
23650 Dwight You did. Several times. Over and over again.
23651 Michael [same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
23652 Dwight [same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
23653 Michael I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
23654 Dwight Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
23655 Michael Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
23656 Dwight You don't keep a diary.
23657 Michael Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
23658 Dwight Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
23659 Michael Why do you have a diary?
23660 Dwight To keep secrets from my computer.
23661 Michael OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
23662 Dwight Impossible.
23663 Michael Yes, you did.
23664 Dwight I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
23665 Michael What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary]
23666 Dwight Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
23667 Michael Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
23668 Dwight With all my heart.

23679 Michael We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
23680 Dwight OK, what am I thinking right now?
23681 Michael Umm, nacho chips.
23682 Dwight No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
23683 Michael Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
23684 Dwight Oh, not gonna happen.
23685 Dwight I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
23686 Michael Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
23687 Dwight What about Shoe La La?

23692 Michael Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
23693 Dwight I love working here and I do not want to leave.
23694 Michael He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
23695 Dwight Well...
23696 Michael I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
23697 Dwight We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
23698 Michael Right.
23699 Dwight No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
23700 Michael That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
23701 Dwight Try me.
23702 Michael That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
23703 Dwight I haven't made a decision yet.
23704 Michael You kind of have.
23705 Dwight No.
23706 Michael Yes.
23707 Jim You cannot take the fall for him.
23708 Dwight He said he would do the same for me.
23709 Jim He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
23710 Dwight I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.

23715 David Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]
23716 Dwight David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
23717 David I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping]
23718 David Alright Dwight. This is huge.
23719 Dwight That's what she said! [David laughs]
23720 Michael Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
23721 Dwight Inspiration.
23722 Michael Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?
23723 Dwight [same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.

23727 Jim And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
23728 Dwight Apology rejected.
23729 Pam [going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
23730 Dwight Oh Pam.
23731 Creed Good work, kid.
23732 Dwight Thanks old man.
23733 David This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
23734 Dwight Yeah.

23737 Michael David? David?
23738 Dwight [same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
23739 Michael David?
23740 David Yeah?
23741 Dwight Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.

23744 Jim No, not exactly.
23745 Dwight Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.

23748 Jim Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
23749 Dwight Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?

23758 Michael [points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
23759 Dwight Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?

23762 Michael I drove.
23763 Dwight Oh, here's one[/b]

23770 Michael Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
23771 Dwight Mr. Peanut is not classy.

23774 Michael Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
23775 Dwight He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.

23778 Michael Clearly that's what you wanted.
23779 Dwight Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.

23782 Michael Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
23783 Dwight Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.

23790 Michael And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
23791 Dwight I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]

23795 Michael Not classy at all.
23796 Dwight Excellent.

23832 David What?
23833 Dwight Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
23834 Michael You have no idea how high I can fly.
23835 Michael Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
23836 Dwight We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...

23891 Michael Well-
23892 Dwight What about your party?

23905 David You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.
23906 Dwight Ask him about the party.
23907 Michael Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
23908 David I'll give it my best shot, Michael.
23909 Dwight No the other thing.
23910 Michael Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence]
23911 Dwight He hung up?

23931 Michael [on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
23932 Dwight Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]
23933 Stephanie David Wallace's office.
23934 Dwight Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
23935 Stephanie Good. Thank you.
23936 Dwight How's it hanging?
23937 Stephanie Alright. . .
23938 Dwight Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-

24080 Michael Any good headhunter knows I am available.
24081 Dwight Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,

24167 Charles Okay.
24168 Dwight [examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
24169 Pam No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
24170 Dwight Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in. World War II.
24171 Pam That's a really... well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
24172 Dwight Deutsch... let me see here. That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
24173 Pam Hmm...
24174 Dwight My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.

24205 Andy Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
24206 Dwight Your own paper company.
24207 Michael Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
24208 Dwight Right...
24209 Michael Potential, lots of potential. yes.
24210 Dwight What a courageous venture.
24211 Michael It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...
24212 Dwight Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
24213 Michael That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.
24214 Dwight Okay. So yeah.
24215 Michael So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.
24216 Dwight You know, I would love to put a pin in that.

24282 Charles Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
24283 Dwight No.

24321 Michael Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
24322 Dwight Hustle!

24339 Michael Okay.
24340 Dwight Way to go.

24364 Pam ... Square is fine.
24365 Dwight Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?

24383 Pam I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
24384 Dwight What?

24387 Pam I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
24388 Dwight This is how I breathe.

24391 Pam We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
24392 Dwight If you want to tell me -

24403 Michael You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
24404 Dwight Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]

24505 Jim You bet.
24506 Dwight Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
24507 Jim Well I do.
24508 Dwight Wow.
24509 Jim I play.
24510 Dwight You can be so modest sometimes.
24511 Jim Well, maybe you should get back to work.
24512 Dwight Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
24513 Jim Maybe we will someday.
24514 Dwight Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
24515 Charles That's a great idea, Dwight.
24516 Dwight Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
24517 Jim Yeah.
24518 Dwight I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
24519 Charles What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
24520 Dwight Jim, what do you say?
24521 Angela Sounds fun.
24522 Andy I'm in it to win.
24523 Dwight Game on!

24603 Charles C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
24604 Dwight Wing.

24615 Michael I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
24616 Dwight Cherry Pie, Warrant.

24619 Jim You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
24620 Dwight No! Really?

24623 Charles Hey Kelly?
24624 Dwight Enter Sandman, Metallica.

24627 Charles Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
24628 Dwight Rebel Yell, Billy Idol

24631 Charles Oh, and Kelly...
24632 Dwight Really?

24646 Andy What do you think?
24647 Dwight Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
24648 Andy Thank you!
24649 Dwight Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.

24665 Erin Oh.
24666 Dwight You know there's a ghost in this office
24667 Erin Really?
24668 Dwight A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
24669 Erin Why was she in this building?
24670 Dwight Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
24671 Erin That's crazy.
24672 Dwight Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
24673 Erin Oh my god!
24674 Dwight It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
24675 Erin Hmm.
24676 Dwight That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next. [Taps her shoulder]
24677 Erin Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.]
24678 Dwight Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
24679 Erin Yeah.
24680 Dwight Yeah?
24681 Erin Just got some ice.
24682 Dwight Erin [eerie voice] Erin...

24686 Erin So I'll see you guys around!
24687 Dwight Hey buddy.

24725 Michael They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
24726 Dwight Hey buddy, what are you up to?
24727 Andy Um, nerthing?
24728 Dwight Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your pen1s.
24729 Andy Pffft.
24730 Dwight Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
24731 Andy The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
24732 Dwight And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
24733 Andy No, that's ridiculous.
24734 Dwight No no no.
24735 Andy Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
24736 Dwight Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.

24830 Erin Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
24831 Dwight You're good.

24835 Andy What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
24836 Dwight Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
24837 Andy Really?
24838 Dwight Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
24839 Dwight and Erin West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River [Andy vocalizes]
24840 Dwight In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
24841 Dwight and Andy Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads. [Erin leaves]
24842 Dwight Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh

24883 Andy Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
24884 Dwight It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]

24887 Andy Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
24888 Dwight Spin move.

24891 Andy Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
24892 Dwight Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.

24896 Michael That's very rude.
24897 Dwight These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
24898 Dwight I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
24899 Phyllis I think you look nice.
24900 Mr. Schofield Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-
24901 Dwight Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
24902 Dwight La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
24903 Charles Looking good.
24904 Michael I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
24905 Dwight 'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
24906 Dwight Come on.
24907 Dwight When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
24908 Michael Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
24909 Michael Hey.
24910 Dwight What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
24911 Dwight Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.

24914 Michael That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
24915 Dwight They have some great kitchen ideas.

24918 Michael Good, good, good. I will see you.
24919 Dwight It's small, I know.
24920 Dwight Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
24921 Michael I really appreciate it.
24922 Mr. Schofield Excuse me?
24923 Dwight Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
24924 Michael I color code all my info. I wrote "gay son" in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means "Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?" Most colors mean "Don't say it."
24925 Michael It's for your trouble.
24926 Dwight How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
24927 Dwight Wh- I don't need $6 to help a friend.
24928 Michael I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
24929 Michael No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
24930 Dwight Michael, you know I can't take this.
24931 Michael Yes, I do.
24932 Dwight But don't forget you owe me $10.
24933 Michael That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
24934 Dwight Michael.

24951 Pam I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
24952 Dwight You needed to speak to me?
24953 Charles Dwight, take a seat.
24954 Dwight I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
24955 Charles Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
24956 Dwight Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
24957 Charles I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
24958 Dwight Your concern is noted.
24959 Charles Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
24960 Dwight Like a wolf. Thank you.
24961 Charles And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
24962 Dwight Really?
24963 Charles Definitely.
24964 Dwight [sighs] It's firm.
24965 Michael [on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
24966 Dwight I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
24967 Michael Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
24968 Dwight No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
24969 Michael I'm not following you.
24970 Dwight Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
24971 Michael Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
24972 Dwight Good, do you see what I'm saying?
24973 Michael Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
24974 Dwight No.
24975 Michael Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying "He's talking about you!"]
24976 Dwight No.
24977 Michael [Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?
24978 Dwight It is possible that I could be talking about us.
24979 Michael Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
24980 Dwight It is the situation that we are in now.
24981 Michael So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
24982 Dwight I'm not a barbarian.
24983 Michael Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
24984 Dwight I will.
24985 Michael Dwight?
24986 Dwight Yes?
24987 Michael Is the cool new guy Charles?
24988 Dwight I've said too much.

24999 Michael Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
25000 Dwight I'm sorry, Michael

25011 Charles He did.
25012 Dwight I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.

25032 Jim I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
25033 Dwight [on phone] Dwight Schrute.
25034 Michael Hello, traitor.
25035 Dwight I think you have the wrong number, Michael.

25040 Michael Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.
25041 Dwight [on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?
25042 Secretary He's in a meeting.
25043 Dwight Dammit! [hangs up]

25046 Stanley So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
25047 Dwight I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
25048 Phyllis You sound worried.
25049 Dwight And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]

25053 Michael Wow. High score?
25054 Dwight And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
25055 Dwight Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market. So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
25056 Michael Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
25057 Dwight I would like to arrange a truce.
25058 Michael So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
25059 Dwight Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
25060 Michael No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
25061 Dwight Michael.
25062 Michael Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
25063 Dwight In which direction?
25064 Michael Toward the sun.
25065 Dwight At what time?
25066 Michael Noon.
25067 Dwight That-
25068 Michael You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]
25069 Dwight [looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
25070 Michael Dwight.
25071 Dwight Michael.
25072 Michael I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
25073 Dwight You were making me do things that were not all right.
25074 Michael So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
25075 Dwight And not come through for you?
25076 Michael If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
25077 Dwight I want a truce.
25078 Michael I do too.
25079 Dwight Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
25080 Michael Cooper's.
25081 Dwight I had fish yesterday.
25082 Michael Damn it.
25083 Michael [Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
25084 Dwight Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
25085 Michael Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
25086 Dwight I hit a bear.
25087 Michael What?
25088 Dwight He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
25089 Michael Yeah, sure.
25090 Dwight Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]

25095 Michael [Michael answers phone] Yeah.
25096 Dwight Did you enjoy your lunch?
25097 Michael Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
25098 Dwight No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
25099 Michael No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying "Dwight did it!!"] You?
25100 Dwight Me.
25101 Michael What about our truce?
25102 Dwight I broke it.
25103 Michael On purpose?
25104 Dwight Yes.
25105 Michael Why?
25106 Dwight You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
25107 Michael Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
25108 Dwight And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
25109 Michael Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] b*st*rd!
25110 Dwight Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
25111 Dwight [holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend." [turns card over] "Tall" and "beets."
25112 Dwight And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here.
25113 Michael Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
25114 Dwight Sure. That'd be fine.
25115 Michael If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
25116 Dwight This is war and that is what happens.
25117 Michael Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
25118 Dwight Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
25119 Michael Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
25120 Dwight Michael! Michael!

25123 Michael Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
25124 Dwight Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!

25130 Michael Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
25131 Dwight Are you saying you invented paper?

25170 David No.
25171 Dwight [sighs] Shame, Jim. I expected more.

25190 David Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael. Ryan is--
25191 Dwight It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.

25198 David Insurance, taxes, social security for three people. This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand. You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
25199 Dwight Been there, done that.

25224 Charles Hey, guys--
25225 Dwight David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace. Charles and I were waiting for you.

25252 Charles Okay, great. Uh, Dwight come on in. Also, Jim.
25253 Dwight Come along, afterthought.

25286 Charles God, no.
25287 Dwight Stupid. Yeah, makes us look weak.
25288 Charles I agree.
25289 Dwight I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor.
25290 Jim Really? Does he do good work or--
25291 Dwight [scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
25292 David Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
25293 Dwight Five minutes exactly.
25294 Charles Okay. Hey, Dwight. Can I talk to you?
25295 Dwight Sure thing.

25304 Jim Good, right? Hello.
25305 Dwight [over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way.

25322 Charles We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
25323 Dwight Let me float something out there, okay? Can I just say-- can I say something?
25324 David Yeah, yeah.
25325 Dwight There is a hive of bees outside the front door. We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.

25328 Jim Oh, but you didn't.
25329 Dwight Oh, Man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure.

25334 Jim I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
25335 Dwight You know what? Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me. I'm the man for this job. Charles, you got my back on this?

25398 Pam Are you kidding me?
25399 Dwight Well, Jerry, the one who got away. May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company? Really? Please hold. [gets up and runs to kitchen] Charles.
25400 Charles Dwight.
25401 Dwight May I have your attention? The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
25402 Charles What? How'd you hear that?
25403 Dwight They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures.
25404 Jim Great work Dwight.
25405 Dwight Quiet you.
25406 Jim No, I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
25407 Dwight You don't crack a case. That has pejorative connotation. That's like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
25408 Charles So how long can they stay viable?
25409 Jim What are your top five cases?
25410 Dwight I'm gonna answer Charles first.
25411 Jim Because you've solved zero cases.
25412 Dwight Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit. Missing beets from all over the farm. No footprints. Inside job. Mose in socks. Boom, case closed.
25413 Charles Okay, do not go anywhere near the conference room.
25414 Dwight Done.
25415 Charles Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today. Got it?
25416 Dwight I'm not-- I'm not following you.
25417 Charles You two are morons.
25418 Jim Got it.
25419 Dwight Wh--

25438 Jim Mm-hmm.
25439 Dwight [after a few moments of silence] Wh--what are you doing?

25464 Andy You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
25465 Dwight Wait, what?
25466 Toby All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
25467 Stanley How is that going to work?
25468 Dwight Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.

25471 Phyllis You mean the clients you stole from us.
25472 Dwight No.
25473 Dwight Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
25474 Toby I'm running this meeting.
25475 Michael No, you lost those clients.
25476 Dwight That's debatable.

25480 Meredith Ooh, where has this guy been?
25481 Dwight You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.

25520 Michael You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
25521 Dwight Fresh hot ink.

25524 Michael Oh, really?
25525 Dwight Trust me, Stanley, you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.

25528 Michael Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good.
25529 Dwight No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
25530 Pam What about Ryan?
25531 Dwight When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine.

25544 Michael Could you send her in?
25545 Dwight Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?

25548 Michael Hello.
25549 Dwight Did you even read the memo?

25552 Michael Have a seat.
25553 Dwight No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.

25556 Erin Oh, I can go.
25557 Dwight Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing.
25558 Michael He will be ushering you out. [starts laughing]
25559 Dwight We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.

25562 Michael Oh, your face! Oh!
25563 Dwight No, you're too close.

25566 Michael No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet.
25567 Dwight Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?

25570 Michael Oh...
25571 Dwight He doesn't like it.

25574 Michael I don't know, actually.
25575 Dwight Her face is okay, but-- Jesus! What --what are you doing here?
25576 Erin Okay.
25577 Meredith I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
25578 Dwight Get out! We need to do something. I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
25579 Phyllis Those sound too harsh.
25580 Dwight No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things.
25581 Jim Of course. What is like a hostage?
25582 Dwight Excellent question.
25583 Andy We could write a strong-worded letter.
25584 Dwight Words will never be enough.
25585 Jim Strongly-painted picture.
25586 Dwight No, pictures are too interpretive.
25587 Jim Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
25588 Dwight Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs.
25589 Jim Great. See you upstairs.
25590 Dwight C'mon. [whispers] Guys. Psst, listen. Now is the time for action. I'm talking action--

25622 Michael Hey gang. Where you been?
25623 Dwight Lunch.

25633 Michael I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
25634 Dwight It's pony.

25654 Ryan I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better?
25655 Dwight Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
25656 Ryan Exactly.
25657 Dwight That's my client.
25658 Ryan Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years.
25659 Dwight Give me the phone.
25660 Ryan Things have been generally good.
25661 Dwight Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
25662 Ryan Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
25663 Dwight Hi, Mr. Bart.
25664 Ryan At these prices with this service...
25665 Dwight Hey, it's Dwight here. Give me the phone.
25666 Ryan You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
25667 Dwight Dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up.
25668 Ryan No, no, no. Sir, don't listen.
25669 Dwight I know times are tough right now, and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!

25672 Stanley Who let this boy on the phone?
25673 Dwight Ah! Mr. Bart! Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account. He was my client for ten years!
25674 Pam You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan.
25675 Dwight You're a secretary! What do you know?
25676 Ryan Okay.
25677 Dwight And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone. I'm confiscating this.
25678 Michael Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight.
25679 Dwight We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.

25684 Michael You guys gotta be kidding.
25685 Dwight No, we gotta be deadly serious. We'll start our own paper company. The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.

25692 Stanley That's right.
25693 Dwight Right.

25696 Michael I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
25697 Dwight Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting?
25698 Michael Whatever you guys did earlier.
25699 Dwight I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
25700 Michael Just do it, okay?
25701 Dwight I'll do--
25702 Michael Get 'em there. Get 'em there.
25703 Dwight I'll do the best I can.
25704 Michael Are you kidding me?
25705 Dwight Deceit does not come easy to me.

25718 Michael Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along. [everyone mutters "okay"] However, I rescind my apology.
25719 Dwight That's fair.

25749 Michael Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to "Y".
25750 Dwight Shut up.
25751 Pam This is so cheesy.
25752 Dwight [laughs hysterically] I got her!

25761 Jim Me, too.
25762 Dwight I do.

25801 Kelly Andy, that was just the ice.
25802 Dwight Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.

25805 Kelly Yeah. It was.
25806 Dwight [sighs] Now, how can I help you?
25807 Erin Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
25808 Dwight Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
25809 Pam So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
25810 Dwight It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.

25850 Michael Are you all afwaid?
25851 Dwight No.

25858 Michael Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
25859 Dwight [Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.

25916 Michael Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
25917 Dwight Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
25918 Michael No. No. No.
25919 Dwight Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?

25925 Michael Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
25926 Dwight Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
25927 Michael I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
25928 Dwight What do you think history is?
25929 Michael It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
25930 Michael [barging through office door] Alright. Here we go.
25931 Dwight Out of the way! Move it or lose it!

25935 Phyllis What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
25936 Dwight You want to get sick you go to the hospital.

25947 Michael I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
25948 Dwight [exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.

25960 Michael I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
25961 Dwight You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
25962 Phyllis Dwight! Dwight!
25963 Dwight Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
25964 Phyllis I do.
25965 Dwight No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.

25975 Phyllis That feels good, Dwight.
25976 Dwight Tell me where it hurts.
25977 Phylis Right... mmmm... right there.
25978 Dwight Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.

25988 Michael I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you." [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.
25989 Dwight This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
25990 Phyllis An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
25991 Dwight Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.

25994 Creed No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
25995 Dwight I'm gonna with the python.
25996 Phyllis But the rattler's so scary.
25997 Dwight No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
25998 Phyllis I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
25999 Dwight What's so funny?

26010 Phyllis Wanna dance, Dwight?
26011 Dwight Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
26012 Bob Vance Mind if I steal my wife?
26013 Dwight You can't steal what is legally your property.

26027 Holly I can't wait.
26028 Dwight [whispering] What do you need from me?
26029 Jim [on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
26030 Dwight Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.

26033 Pam How long will that take?
26034 Dwight [changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.

26045 Michael Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
26046 Dwight Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!

26058 Pam Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
26059 Dwight Okay. Fine.

26062 Pam Tell them what happened last year.
26063 Dwight Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?

26066 Pam No, no, that guy who hit on me.
26067 Dwight No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?

26070 Pam Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
26071 Dwight Seven? Can I finish please?
26072 Jim Well...
26073 David Okay.
26074 Dwight I'm gonna say 30.
26075 Dwight Eight?
26076 Rolph Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF.
26077 Jim [on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
26078 Dwight Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
26079 Rolph Woah. Homemade?
26080 Dwight Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
26081 Dwight Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.

26105 Jim No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
26106 Dwight Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
26107 Jim Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
26108 Dwight Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
26109 Andy Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
26110 Dwight Why? I don't understand.
26111 Andy If-
26112 Dwight Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
26113 Andy Uh... [laughs sheepishly]
26114 Dwight I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
26115 Andy That's...
26116 Dwight Sly dog.
26117 Andy ... not what I meant.
26118 Dwight Come on, folks!

26140 Kevin [playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]
26141 Dwight Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
26142 Andy Are you blind?!
26143 Dwight I could've gotten that, idiot!
26144 Andy Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
26145 Dwight It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
26146 Phyllis We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
26147 Dwight [grunts in frustration]
26148 Dwight [playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
26149 Woman So what?
26150 Dwight Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?

26154 Jim Nice job, Beesly.
26155 Dwight Yes! We advance to the next round!

26163 Holly Crystal cool.
26164 Dwight [playing volleyball] Hit it Andy!
26165 Andy Bump! I bumped it!
26166 Kevin Set!
26167 Dwight Don't set it to yourself!
26168 Kevin [Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
26169 Phyllis Ow, my ankle!
26170 Dwight What happened?
26171 Phyllis I... twisted it.
26172 Dwight You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!

26194 Rolph You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!
26195 Dwight Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]

26200 Kendall Really funny.
26201 Dwight Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]

26246 Meredith Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
26247 Dwight Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
26248 Pam How do you figure?
26249 Dwight Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.

26256 Rolph Here's an accounting question for you[/b]
26257 Dwight Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
26258 Rolph What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-
26259 Dwight Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
26260 Rolph No way! You don't mean that!
26261 Dwight Rolph, leave it alone!
26262 Erin [hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
26263 Pam [running for the ball] I got it!
26264 Dwight Pam!

26279 Charles Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
26280 Dwight [whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.

26283 Pam We'll be back!
26284 Dwight Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]

26298 Michael Nowhere.
26299 Dwight [walking on Pam's desk, then Jim's desk] Extreme! Parkour!
26300 Dwight Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]
26301 Jim This... is Parkour. [turns laptop to camera, shows Parkour instructional video] Internet sensation of 2004. And it was in one of the Bond films. It's pretty impressive. [Michael is shown climbing/walking on various objects in office] The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
26302 Pam Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator]
26303 Dwight [stands on his hands kicking open bathroom doors as Andy films, Meredith is seen applying deodorant in women's bathroom]

26306 Pam Don't... get... on. Do not.
26307 Dwight Andy! Leapfrog! [Andy leapfrogs Dwight]

26310 Kevin Stay.
26311 Dwight Yeah! [Dwight jumps on Andy's back, riding him like a horse] Parkour! Parkour!

26314 Creed Come on, boss.
26315 Dwight Okay.

26318 Michael [to everyone, in conference room] Okay, I made it all up.
26319 Dwight [crouching beside car] Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera! [Michael feebly attempts to jump off car, gives double thumbs up to camera]

26330 Angela No. We heard that about Jim.
26331 Dwight Let's do it!

26338 Oscar Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...
26339 Dwight [on telephone] Good. Excellent. Thank you.

26342 Michael Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
26343 Dwight [chugs water, throws away cup] Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?

26346 Phyllis We have a right to know.
26347 Dwight Go put them all in random order.

26350 Michael [sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...
26351 Dwight Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.

26365 Michael If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.
26366 Dwight Who's the father?

26398 Michael Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your v*g1n*! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael]
26399 Dwight [typing] Okay, let me finish this thought.

26402 Michael [to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?
26403 Dwight [still typing] He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night

26406 Michael A week? A month? A year?
26407 Dwight [still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?

26448 Michael Hold on a second, Cynthia.
26449 Dwight Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.

26567 Michael [with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
26568 Dwight [giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
26569 Eric Why would we call you at night?
26570 Dwight [grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
26571 Jim [to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
26572 Dwight Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.

26625 Michael [knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah?
26626 Dwight I'm... I was making it.

26639 Oscar I'm sure everything will be fine. [pulls up a chair] What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?
26640 Dwight AHHHHHHHHHHHH!

26694 Darryl Yes.
26695 Dwight Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
26696 Darryl This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.
26697 Dwight Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
26698 Darryl If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.
26699 Dwight Nnnnn, that's not... okay.
26700 Darryl Be quiet.
26701 Dwight I'm talking about... hmmm.
26702 Toby I will send this off to corporate. Make sure you hold on to your medical bills. Feel better.
26703 Darryl Thanks T-Man, later. [fist bumps Toby}
26704 Dwight So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.
26705 Toby He has a doctor's note.
26706 Dwight Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders.
26707 Toby A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news.
26708 Dwight Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake? [imitating Darryl] Y'all having birthday cake?
26709 Toby That's not a very good Darryl.
26710 Dwight Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
26711 Toby Hmmm.
26712 Dwight It just doesn't add up.

26758 Toby [spying at Darryl's house] Sounds like a EMDP-40.
26759 Dwight Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
26760 Toby You're into trains?
26761 Dwight I have been my whole life.
26762 Toby Wow.
26763 Dwight I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
26764 Toby That's so cool.
26765 Dwight Yeah.
26766 Toby Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.
26767 Dwight Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
26768 Toby Well, you know, 'cause of the trains.
26769 Dwight Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.
26770 Toby Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.
26771 Dwight Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera!
26772 Toby Get over there! Get over there!
26773 Dwight Oh, worker's comp, my ass!
26774 Toby I can't believe this. [mistaking Darryl's sister for Darryl] Hey you, ass****!
26775 Dwight Toby...
26776 Toby You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?
26777 Dwight Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans] Oh man! You okay?

26826 Jim I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.
26827 Dwight I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated.

26831 Darryl You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.
26832 Dwight We thought that she was you.
26833 Darryl Why would you think a lady is me?
26834 Dwight Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this?
26835 Toby No, nah. I don't see it.
26836 Darryl Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.
26837 Dwight Aww, Darryl.

26852 Darryl Cool.
26853 Dwight Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
26854 Toby What?
26855 Dwight He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
26856 Darryl Stupidest thing I've ever heard.
26857 Dwight Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby.
26858 Toby Well, I don't think there's any reason to check 'em but I suppose if we wanted to be really certain...
26859 Darryl Alright, yeah fine so whatever...
26860 Dwight Yes!
26861 Toby You really did it...
26862 Dwight Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
26863 Darryl And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.
26864 Dwight Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that...

26890 David Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second. [Michael picks up phone] Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do?
26891 Dwight Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
26892 Michael Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?
26893 Dwight [in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?

26896 Jim Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.
26897 Dwight [in Jim's office] Sign this.

26900 Erin Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond. [Michael and Jim leave, Dwight sneaks in]
26901 Dwight Sign it.
26902 Dwight People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
26903 Jim No, not without a "please."
26904 Dwight Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table] That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
26905 Dwight Idiot.
26906 Oscar What the hell?!
26907 Dwight [in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.
26908 Dwight Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
26909 Michael That is not big picture.
26910 Michael Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
26911 Dwight I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.

26914 Pam Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?
26915 Dwight Jim won't sign my expense report.

26918 Pam Jim?
26919 Dwight No, that is huge.

26922 Kevin What does a bean mean?!
26923 Dwight This has to do--

26926 Meredith Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.
26927 Dwight [in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.

26930 Angela This is how you make this important decision?
26931 Dwight You!

26934 Phyllis It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!
26935 Dwight One minute ago.

26938 Phyllis Yeah, I would, too.
26939 Dwight Angry.
26940 Dwight Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
26941 Jim All right. Did he hit you?
26942 Phyllis I say no.
26943 Dwight No.
26944 Dwight No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.
26945 Jim Did you cry?
26946 Michael [leaving his office, hurrying to Jim's office]
26947 Dwight No.

26950 Michael [in Jim's office] How you doing?
26951 Dwight No.

26954 Michael Oh, what are you usually?
26955 Dwight Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.

26958 Michael Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.
26959 Dwight I'm not cr-- uhh!
26960 Jim I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?
26961 Dwight I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!

27149 Kelly No! [put's down her bags] How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!
27150 Dwight This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
27151 Jim Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
27152 Dwight What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!

27159 Kevin Yeah.
27160 Dwight Her kid needs shoes, Jim!

27184 Meredith I am so pissed at this company!
27185 Dwight [out the side of his mouth] And Jim!
27186 Meredith Yeah. Who said that?
27187 Dwight I think it was Creed.

27202 Oscar [to Kevin who is bouncing up and down] What are you doing?
27203 Dwight Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.

27211 Kevin The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on.
27212 Dwight Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.

27253 Pam's mom Oh--
27254 Dwight Come on. You've got to be kidding me.

27292 Stanley No.
27293 Dwight We'll see.

27300 Mema People are like cats and dogs these days.
27301 Dwight Toby.

27306 Mema This used to be such a great country.
27307 Dwight I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.

27312 Mema I don't know what happened to it.
27313 Dwight [looks over and sees hole in his present] Crap. [sees turtle on the ground, goes over and picks it up] Come here you.

27319 Pam's dad Hey. What happened?
27320 Dwight But you can say that about anything.

27325 Jim Well we are here now, so let's just--
27326 Dwight What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.

27334 Pam You look great.
27335 Dwight It's easy. That's what I'm saying.

27343 Pam Mm-hmm.
27344 Dwight I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.

27349 Pam Yes I did.
27350 Dwight Yes.

27355 Pam [smiles] Go ahead. I think it's your turn.
27356 Dwight For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.

27361 Pam Yeah, I'm okay.
27362 Dwight Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.

27367 Michael Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
27368 Dwight Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.

27373 Jim I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her.
27374 Dwight She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.

27377 Michael Is that all you have on her?
27378 Dwight What? It's a casual, social outfit.
27379 Dwight Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
27380 Michael Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.
27381 Michael You're an idiot.
27382 Dwight No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during s*x.

27391 Erin Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.
27392 Dwight I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.

27397 Jim Yeah?
27398 Dwight Nine and three-quarters.
27399 Pam She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.
27400 Dwight I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.

27403 Pam Yeah.
27404 Dwight Michael.

27407 Pam Oh.
27408 Dwight Drop this one. Abort.

27411 Pam We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.
27412 Dwight I found twins.
27413 Michael [in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.
27414 Michael Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
27415 Dwight What? No way!
27416 Dwight Aren't they magnificent?
27417 Michael Those glasses are super dark.
27418 Michael They're men, Dwight.
27419 Dwight Oh. God.
27420 Dwight I love finding a good set of twins.
27421 Michael Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
27422 Michael Something is wrong with you.
27423 Dwight You know what? I made you a cd...

27426 Andy You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.
27427 Dwight Mmm-hmm.

27430 Andy How about a little bit of this.
27431 Dwight This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.

27434 Kevin What else you got?
27435 Dwight You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] "Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--" [Michael turns off cd]

27438 Erin What else you got?
27439 Dwight Yeah. It's practical.

27470 Jim Uh...
27471 Dwight The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.

27477 Michael I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
27478 Dwight [over phone] Hey-O!
27479 Front Desk Clerk Oh, ok. Unfortunately, sir, the block only applies to the rate. I'm afraid we're all sold out.
27480 Jim Pam, it just happened.
27481 Dwight Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number

27484 Jim I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
27485 Dwight And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?

27488 Pam Are you pushing me off the phone?
27489 Dwight Ok.

27494 Michael Mmm! It's after midnight. [points at Jim]
27495 Dwight No way. What if I meet someone?
27496 Michael and Dwight You're married. [hugs Jim] He's married!
27497 Michael I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight.
27498 Dwight Congratulations.
27499 Dwight No. No.
27500 Jim That's not how that works.
27501 Michael I would do the same for you.
27502 Dwight Oh my goodness.
27503 Dwight You would?
27504 Michael Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back.
27505 Michael Yes.
27506 Dwight You'll have Pam to answer to.
27507 Dwight Really?
27508 Michael She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons." [Dwight laughs] "And... and clip my toenails."
27509 Michael Yes... just go--
27510 Dwight "Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV."
27511 Dwight Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.

27514 Andy Are you sure this is the right way?
27515 Dwight Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?

27518 Andy Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.
27519 Dwight Please?

27522 Andy I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so--
27523 Dwight Mmm-hmm.

27526 Andy Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--
27527 Dwight Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.

27530 Andy [snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.
27531 Dwight No you do not.

27534 Andy No. No that was real.
27535 Dwight It worked.

27567 Mr. Halpert So, which one is Pam's grandma?
27568 Dwight [walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?

27571 Jim Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?
27572 Dwight Cell phone? Charger?

27575 Michael Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.
27576 Dwight It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel.

27579 Mr. Halpert Oh.
27580 Dwight You know it.

27583 Mr. Halpert Hi.
27584 Dwight Okay, get out of here.

27587 Mr. Halpert Nice to meet you.
27588 Dwight Okay.

27591 Jim Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
27592 Dwight [lays on bed] Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots.

27595 Jim Pretty sure everyone heard that.
27596 Dwight I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You?

27599 Pam Hey, Mema.
27600 Dwight Hey, what was she like?

27603 Pam Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.
27604 Dwight Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?

27607 Jim Mr. Beesly. How are ya?
27608 Dwight No kidding.

27611 Jim Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?
27612 Dwight I bet she had hairy armpits.
27613 Mr. Beesly [laughs] No no. She's my girlfriend. Hey? Can you make room at the head table?
27614 Michael No.
27615 Dwight From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
27616 Dwight Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
27617 Little Girl Why would they make the bad man a boss if you're so much smarter?
27618 Michael Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?
27619 Dwight Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
27620 Dwight No.
27621 Kids Ewwww!
27622 Michael She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?
27623 Dwight That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
27624 Dwight Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.

27627 Oscar Pleased to meet you.
27628 Dwight Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass.

27631 Kevin She thought I was your boyfriend.
27632 Dwight You should ask her out.

27673 Michael Head table, where I belong.
27674 Dwight I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
27675 Dwight It's just for family.

27678 Pam Thank you weirdo.
27679 Dwight Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. [laughs] In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.

27682 Pam Okay, here I come. [walks out in her wedding dress]
27683 Dwight That's a very good record.

27706 Jim Is this allowed?
27707 Dwight Knight Rider.
27708 Pam No. No, but I'm allowing it. Just come here.
27709 Michael That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
27710 Dwight [talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.
27711 Dwight No.
27712 Isabel Hello stranger. How do I look?
27713 Michael That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]
27714 Dwight Oh. Fine. Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you. What do you want?
27715 Dwight Very smart.
27716 Isabel Um... [shakes head] nothing. Anymore.
27717 Michael And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
27718 Dwight [turns back to other woman] So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.

27751 Toby Well the "fun" is in it. [conference room group chimes agreement.]
27752 Dwight I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?

27759 Andy Golf.
27760 Dwight It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.

27763 Andy Stock market.
27764 Dwight Do you know what "snap decision" means?

27767 Andy Dave Matthews.
27768 Dwight It means like this. [snaps fingers]

27825 Kevin Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.
27826 Dwight We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
27827 Andy What do you think?
27828 Andy He's alive. So you're welcome.
27829 Dwight I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
27830 Dwight Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.

27833 Michael Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
27834 Dwight Not the living in fear, that's new.

27837 Michael Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
27838 Dwight Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.

27841 Michael Okay, well.
27842 Dwight Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?

27845 Michael Do your worst. [they shake hands]
27846 Dwight Yeah...

27849 Grotti Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?
27850 Dwight What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!

27853 Andy What happened in there?
27854 Dwight Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened.
27855 Michael Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
27856 Dwight Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
27857 Dwight Did he threaten you?

27861 Andy Mobsters are!
27862 Dwight It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.

27866 Michael But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.
27867 Dwight I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
27868 Andy He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.
27869 Oscar Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?
27870 Dwight And he made us all look like chumps!
27871 Dwight No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.

27882 Michael Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
27883 Dwight Exactly.

27899 Ryan What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
27900 Dwight Okay that's-

27903 Andy and Dwight [groans] Oh no. Fabulous.
27904 Dwight That's good, let's wrap it up.

27916 Andy Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!
27917 Dwight No I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it "murder." And not "muck-duck."
27918 Michael No. What do you mean?
27919 Michael Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
27920 Dwight We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
27921 Dwight Lock your door!
27922 Michael What?
27923 Michael I'm not gonna lock my door. [door closes. Then clicks locked]
27924 Dwight You successfully backed down the mob!

27931 Oscar It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.
27932 Dwight Very close.

27948 Michael Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
27949 Dwight That's bad.

27952 Michael Go. Any questions?
27953 Dwight That's bad.

27962 Pam Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.
27963 Dwight He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.

27968 Michael Shh!
27969 Dwight You know what?
27970 Michael That's not gonna happen.
27971 Dwight That's an exaggeration.

27975 Michael I was thinking exactly the same thing.
27976 Dwight No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
27977 Andy Dwight...
27978 Dwight The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
27979 Michael I don't know, I don't know about that.
27980 Andy Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.
27981 Dwight Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
27982 Andy Okay.
27983 Dwight Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.

27991 Andy Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.
27992 Dwight Do you know how to use it?

27995 Andy Should I change?
27996 Dwight You're wearing loafers!

27999 Andy Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.
28000 Dwight Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
28001 Andy Oh! God! [smacks roaches]
28002 Michael Oh my God!
28003 Dwight You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-

28009 Andy Hi.
28010 Dwight Hello.

28033 Grotti If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy.
28034 Dwight Oh he's not that nice.

28046 Michael I don't, I don't have to have that.
28047 Dwight What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.

28050 Michael That's okay.
28051 Dwight Bring him the gabba-gool!

28079 Michael I don't...
28080 Dwight He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
28081 Michael Okay, okay okay.
28082 Dwight So we're choosing...
28083 Michael Yep, all right.
28084 Dwight Check out Dental?

28094 Andy It was before, my tech- my technical training.
28095 Dwight Don't do it!
28096 Andy Do it.
28097 Dwight Don't.

28100 Grotti Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?
28101 Dwight Yes.

28125 Toby I'm good...
28126 Dwight Yeah!

28129 Toby [walks up to Pam's desk with a binder] Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?
28130 Dwight Its Jim and Pam, Michael.

28133 Toby Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.
28134 Dwight Yeah...

28161 Michael [Pam storms into break room] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will.
28162 Dwight This conversation has two items on the agenda.

28165 Michael Well, that is not gonna happen!
28166 Dwight Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!

28169 Michael Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
28170 Dwight [duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]
28171 Pam Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh[beep] about your happiness! Stop dating my mother!
28172 Dwight I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
28173 Michael You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
28174 Dwight I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.

28177 Michael You know what it means.
28178 Dwight Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.

28188 Pam Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.
28189 Dwight Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...

28192 Pam [laughs] I think it'll be okay.
28193 Dwight [walks into Jim's office and takes out ear piece] I'm sorry.

28196 Pam Great.
28197 Dwight Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.

28200 Michael I have recently taken a lover.
28201 Dwight Oh, I'm equipped... I can...

28204 Michael Pam's mom.
28205 Dwight Don't tell Michael...

28208 Michael Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
28209 Dwight Punishment fits the crime, I accept. [shakes Jim's hand and leaves]

28242 Michael Get the hell out of here, idiot.
28243 Dwight [walks into Jims office, twists the top of the pen that he placed in Jim's pen holder which has a bug in it, pushes play] [Jim's voice] "We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our..." [pauses recording] I've got eight hours of this. Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe. Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard? I'm not insane. [starts the recording again] "...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer."

28303 Pam [screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]
28304 Dwight [to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
28305 Michael Okay.
28306 Dwight There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
28307 Michael [sighs] Feels good.
28308 Dwight There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
28309 Michael I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.
28310 Dwight ...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.

28325 Andy [both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.
28326 Dwight [Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
28327 Andy I know, right?
28328 Dwight What were you talking about in there?

28335 Michael Who wants to help the world one step at a time? [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.
28336 Dwight Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.

28375 Pam Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!
28376 Dwight I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.

28399 Erin Hi Dwight!
28400 Dwight [Dwight storms through the break room listening to Kelly and Ryan in his ear piece] Shh!
28401 Ryan [Ryan and Kelly talking] ...it should go with the persona you already have.
28402 Kelly Well, I think I have that persona.
28403 Dwight Where did you get that mallard?
28404 Kelly What the hell is a mallard?
28405 Dwight That!
28406 Kelly Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.
28407 Dwight Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
28408 Kelly If you take it back, I'll scream.
28409 Dwight [sighs heavily] I'll give you five bucks for it.
28410 Ryan Twenty.
28411 Dwight Ten.

28444 Andy I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.
28445 Dwight I'm Jigsaw, idiot.

28507 Michael Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.
28508 Dwight Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.

28519 Michael What are you gonna call him?
28520 Dwight Judas.
28521 Jim Dave.
28522 Dwight Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-

28578 Michael It rained.
28579 Dwight Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?

28631 Michael Ok.
28632 Dwight Michael?
28633 Michael Yes.
28634 Dwight A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.

28638 Phyllis And when you fell in, did you flounder?
28639 Dwight Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -

28650 Michael We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? [writes 'Koi pond' on the list] Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
28651 Dwight I don't want people making fun of my nose.
28652 Michael Your nose?
28653 Dwight It's too small.
28654 Michael Alright.
28655 Oscar Oh my. That is small.
28656 Dwight Just, write it down, please.
28657 Oscar Can you breathe okay?
28658 Kelly What keeps your glasses on?
28659 Dwight Hey! It's on the list, everybody.

28702 Michael No, no.
28703 Dwight Thank you. [everyone begins to leave]

28724 Michael Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.
28725 Dwight Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.

28735 Andy Well, that went pretty well.
28736 Dwight Good morning everybody. Who would like an authentic New York bagel? Hmmm? Stanley?

28739 Michael Because of all the good work you've done.
28740 Dwight No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.

28743 Michael That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude.
28744 Dwight Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?

28749 Pam Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]
28750 Dwight Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one.
28751 Michael Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached. [Pam sighs] And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
28752 Dwight Good morning Michael.

28755 Michael No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
28756 Dwight Hungry?

28759 Michael What?
28760 Dwight Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.

28763 Michael [nervous laughter] Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?
28764 Dwight You're thinking of deer pen1s.

28767 Michael Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
28768 Dwight Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry. [holds up tray] Bagel?

28771 Michael Okay.
28772 Dwight K. I brought cheese too.

28775 Michael Okay.
28776 Dwight Excellent.

28779 Michael Okay.
28780 Dwight Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.
28781 Pam See you then.
28782 Dwight Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical?
28783 Michael See you.
28784 Dwight Pam, would you care for a bagel?

28787 Michael Hey.
28788 Dwight That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.

28883 Toby Okay.
28884 Dwight Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.

28887 Kevin My money's on Pam.
28888 Dwight Wow--

28891 Kevin Michael could win.
28892 Dwight I will. [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face]

28895 Kevin Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?
28896 Dwight Let me get that door for you-- [runs to open door]

28899 Michael It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home.
28900 Dwight There you go!

28903 Michael You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?
28904 Dwight Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.

28907 Pam Are you ready?
28908 Dwight Observe. [walks towards desk]

28911 Pam [goes to punch Michael
28912 Dwight Right?

28915 Pam Michael, you have to put your hands down.
28916 Dwight Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay.

28919 Michael Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
28920 Dwight [straightens Andy's tie] And that needs to be straight as an arrow.

28923 Michael So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.
28924 Dwight Thank you very much for that.

28927 Michael Maybe that--
28928 Dwight [pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat. Allow me.

28931 Michael Yes.
28932 Dwight You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.

28935 Michael Okay. I promise. [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him
28936 Dwight No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]

28939 Pam Are you okay?
28940 Dwight Andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game.

28948 Michael What table should we take? So many to choose from.
28949 Dwight [walks with Michael back into the office

28952 Helene [sees table decorated with a banner and balloons] Oh my God!
28953 Dwight Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.

28958 Michael Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.
28959 Dwight Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down.

28962 Michael Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
28963 Dwight Fire Jim.

28966 Michael Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.
28967 Dwight I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him.

28970 Helene [laughs] Sticking with 49.
28971 Dwight Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers.

28974 Michael That's funny.
28975 Dwight Can I have an office?

28978 Jim Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]
28979 Dwight You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it.

29013 Andy [singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food]
29014 Dwight What's going on in here?
29015 Oscar Andy bought lunch.
29016 Dwight Oh... no... really?
29017 Andy Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.
29018 Dwight There is no book. There's only a survival guide.
29019 Andy You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.
29020 Dwight Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!

29052 Andy Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this.
29053 Dwight Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered.
29054 Andy No, I insist.
29055 Dwight No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist. [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]
29056 Andy Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.
29057 Dwight Don't worry about it. You can just owe me.

29084 Andy [reaching for something on the top shelf] Ahh.
29085 Dwight What's going on?
29086 Andy Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.
29087 Dwight Alright, move it.
29088 Andy What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost.
29089 Dwight Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
29090 Andy It's like a little envelope-- there you go.
29091 Dwight Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha-- [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.
29092 Andy Surprise! [laughs] It's from everybody. $15 value.
29093 Dwight Dammit. I am no closer to taking Jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor] They're mushrooms. They don't get that high.

29102 Michael Yes. Join me please, won't you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office] I am going to give you a raise.
29103 Dwight [screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling] Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you!

29106 Jim Yeah, I want to go home.
29107 Dwight How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]
29108 Pam Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]
29109 Jim OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
29110 Dwight No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go!
29111 Kevin No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.
29112 Dwight False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!
29113 Jim OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
29114 Dwight That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.
29115 Jim So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
29116 Dwight Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch] Block. Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist]
29117 Jim And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.
29118 Dwight Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself] Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh!
29119 Jim Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
29120 Dwight He really is, but not for long. [steps on foot] Ow! Instep, oh, not again. [more screaming] You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
29121 Jim You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
29122 Dwight The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans]

29128 Andy It was hilarious.
29129 Dwight Michael?
29130 Michael Yes?
29131 Dwight What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
29132 Michael You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
29133 Dwight This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
29134 Michael Woo hoo, shout out!
29135 Dwight Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.

29151 Michael Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory.
29152 Dwight You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.

29173 Jim Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.
29174 Dwight [Michael leaves] He needs me. Seat saved infinity. [leaves]

29222 Phyllis You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK? [in character] I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.
29223 Dwight Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
29224 Michael No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.
29225 Dwight I will poison your food.

29238 Andy Alright, a plan it is.
29239 Dwight Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
29240 Angela It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.
29241 Dwight I know you did it!
29242 Dwight I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.

29268 Michael No it ain't.
29269 Dwight Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.

29281 Erin I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.
29282 Dwight You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
29283 Michael I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
29284 Dwight Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
29285 Michael This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir.
29286 Dwight Answer me.
29287 Michael You are out of order.
29288 Dwight You are out of order.

29303 Meredith [laying on the ground] I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.
29304 Dwight Hey shut up. You're dead.

29335 Stanley Super.
29336 Dwight Oh, this could be a juicy one.

29340 Andy [Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!
29341 Dwight OK, everybody just calm down.
29342 Andy I am calm.
29343 Michael On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.
29344 Dwight I have crossbows.
29345 Michael We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
29346 Dwight OK, I'm ready.

29351 Michael It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
29352 Dwight Bow down before Recyclops.

29355 Michael That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
29356 Dwight Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?

29359 Michael O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?
29360 Dwight Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?

29363 Michael Wow, man. That -
29364 Dwight Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.

29367 Michael That was embarrassing.
29368 Dwight Recyclops will have his revenge.

29373 Oscar You -[Oscar walks away, Michael goes back in the room]
29374 Dwight Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office]

29377 O'Keefe He's our best manager? Where's the off button on this moron?
29378 Dwight Yes.

29381 Michael [zipping through the hall while texting]
29382 Dwight Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something]

29385 O'Keefe He can take the bus. He's had his limo ride.
29386 Dwight Humans are terrible for the environment.

29390 Jim Mmm.
29391 Dwight Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.

29394 Jim God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]
29395 Dwight Yeah.

29405 Phyllis Lose the twirl.
29406 Dwight The twirl sucks.

29423 Michael [everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.
29424 Dwight What kind of mileage does this baby get?

29427 Michael Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
29428 Dwight Calves. Calves all the way.

29441 Michael Definitely.
29442 Dwight Smells like it.
29443 Michael Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.
29444 Dwight Word.

29459 Michael I will have to answer.
29460 Dwight I'll ask you a question.
29461 Andy Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.
29462 Dwight Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?

29474 Andy Kay.
29475 Dwight Good luck, Michael.

29491 Registrar For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles.
29492 Dwight Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]
29493 Dwight I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.

29497 Andy Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?
29498 Dwight How is he gonna have grandkids?

29511 Man in line Sure.
29512 Dwight No. You will not.
29513 Woman in line Excuse me?
29514 Dwight Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
29515 Woman in line It'll just be a second.
29516 Dwight Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
29517 Alan ... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager.
29518 Dwight [loudly applauds] Yes.

29645 Andy Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.
29646 Dwight Apparently.

29649 Andy I don't-just people. For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.
29650 Dwight Not now, Temp.

29653 Andy [baby voice] Tank you Mr. Elwis.
29654 Dwight What? Diabolical plan? I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan]

29657 Andy Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.
29658 Dwight So what do you want?

29697 Andy Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea!
29698 Dwight Yeah! Your idea.
29699 Dwight My idea. I just need Andy to think it's his idea. So it won't get traced back to me. In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace. He will be fired.

29726 Michael Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?
29727 Dwight Hey Jimmy, what's up?
29728 Jim Not much.
29729 Dwight Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
29730 Jim [laughs] Thanks Dwight.
29731 Dwight That laugh is so infectious.
29732 Jim You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go.
29733 Dwight I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work.
29734 Jim Let me guess, you think you should get it.
29735 Dwight This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
29736 Jim Well, in an ideal world...
29737 Dwight In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
29738 Jim Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense."
29739 Dwight I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.

29766 Michael Wow!
29767 Dwight Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
29768 Kevin Hey.
29769 Dwight So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
29770 Kevin Jim said that?
29771 Dwight He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
29772 Kevin Jim said that?
29773 Dwight You seem suprised.
29774 Kevin No, no, that makes total sense.
29775 Dwight Hey buddy, so every-
29776 Oscar Sure. [puts in the twenty]
29777 Dwight Five minutes ahead of schedule. Right on schedule.

29784 Oscar Are you kidding me?
29785 Dwight Oh, no!

29792 Jim Dwight?
29793 Dwight Yeah, you said "In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize." Isn't that what you said?

29811 Jim Okay.
29812 Dwight My idea!

29815 Phyllis That's fair.
29816 Dwight Excellent idea, Pam.

29819 Phyllis How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?
29820 Dwight There must be some reasonable explanation for this.

29828 Angela "It could only be you!" Way to go.
29829 Dwight He knew all along!
29830 Kelly I'm going to have some cake.
29831 Stephanie David Wallace's office.
29832 Dwight [imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
29833 Stephanie No, he's in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message?
29834 Dwight Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
29835 Dwight [imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace.
29836 Dwight [imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things are getting really bad down here.

29861 Jim I really don't know how it happened, David.
29862 Dwight I know how it happened.

29865 David Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you.
29866 Dwight No!
29867 David It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job, right?
29868 Dwight What?
29869 Jim Yeah. Thank you.
29870 Dwight No.
29871 David Okay. Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?
29872 Dwight What?
29873 Jim Yes.
29874 David Okay.
29875 Dwight Oh, you're kidding me!
29876 Jim See you.
29877 Dwight Damn it!

29881 Michael Yes.
29882 Dwight [yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--

29885 Michael I didn't say anything!
29886 Dwight --the party planning committee...

29889 Michael We're going out of business!
29890 Dwight But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.

29893 Jim What?
29894 Dwight Merry Christmas. Good.
29895 Dwight You are kidding me!
29896 Dwight My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
29897 Jim Wait wait wait, who said that?
29898 Dwight It is time to unveil the tree.
29899 Michael David told me on the phone. David told me.
29900 Oscar Hey, Rockefeller Center!
29901 Dwight When? When did he tell you? Today?

29904 Ryan Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.
29905 Dwight Awww!

29910 Jim No, it's not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie.
29911 Dwight Aaaarrhh! [kicks over Christmas tree]
29912 Dwight It is warm feelings.

29915 Angela Come on!
29916 Dwight Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join]

29919 Michael David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.
29920 Dwight Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...

29931 Michael Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
29932 Dwight Exactly.

29935 David Hey Sweetie, what is it?
29936 Dwight Everyone.

29943 David Michael, I have never-
29944 Dwight Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...

29947 David Ever, ever...
29948 Dwight Like the spirit of Christmas!
29949 Michael David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
29950 Stanley We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?
29951 Dwight Hey David.
29952 Dwight This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!

29961 Michael Well I think we're past that now.
29962 Dwight Hey Santa!

29976 Phyllis It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!
29977 Dwight Yeah!

29980 Phyllis Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!
29981 Dwight [singing] I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone. [Meredith and Madge help right the Christmas tree]
29982 Creed What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?
29983 Dwight It's true. We all walk alone.

29986 Phyllis Yeah.
29987 Dwight [singing] My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
29988 Dwight For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!

30002 Pam Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.
30003 Dwight I have no idea.

30006 Michael Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?
30007 Dwight Michael? Please! Come on!

30016 Jim No, I'm not gonna do that.
30017 Dwight Oh man! [Dwight dropped a walnut into the nutcracker] I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...

30054 Michael All right, just say "some toys" please.
30055 Dwight It's real slippery out here. [sound of drummer's starts]

30118 Office Aw, Michael!
30119 Dwight Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
30120 Phyllis How do you know it's a gun?
30121 Dwight What else does it look like?
30122 Stanley Not a gun.
30123 Dwight Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
30124 Stanley Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.
30125 Dwight Not a gun. [crosses gun off his "what could it be" list]

30151 Phyllis This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!
30152 Dwight We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot. [grabs package]
30153 Michael [on karaoke microphone] Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
30154 Dwight Yes! [Dwight opens package to reveal another machine part]

30201 Michael You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
30202 Dwight What's your pin number?
30203 Michael I don't want to say. But, "it's fun to stay at the -" [nods to fill in blank, but Dwight doesn't know]
30204 Michael "It's fun to stay at the -"
30205 Dwight Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...

30247 Michael - follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two. [Toby's chair spins around to reveal Dwight filling in for Toby]
30248 Dwight Oh, we will. Have a seat. [Michael gives a pleased look then exits]
30249 Michael I left a copy of Best American Mystery Stories 1999 in Toby's favorite stall. So, yes, I think I bought us some time.
30250 Eric So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character.
30251 Dwight He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
30252 Toby What are, are you doing at my desk?
30253 Dwight Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
30254 Toby Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.
30255 Dwight Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. [laughs] Welcome. [Dwight exits]

30299 Michael That's, that is true. [clip montage]
30300 Dwight [as Eric is being escorted out by Michael and Toby] Thank you, so much.

30305 Angela Have a great day.
30306 Dwight Hope to see you soon.

30318 Michael [extended Lazy Scranton video] Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'.
30319 Dwight Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.

30322 Michael They call it Scranton!
30323 Dwight What?
30324 Michael The Electric City. Scranton!
30325 Dwight What?
30326 Michael The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider.
30327 Dwight But check that it's covered by your
30328 Both Healthcare Provider!
30329 Michael Plenty of space in the parking lot.
30330 Dwight But the little cars go in the compact spot!
30331 Both Spot. Spot. Spot. Spot. Spot.
30332 Michael Snack attack time.
30333 Dwight Don't lose your head.

30336 Michael They call it Scranton!
30337 Dwight What?
30338 Michael The Electric City. Scranton!
30339 Dwight What?
30340 Michael The Electric City. Scranton!
30341 Dwight What?
30342 Michael The Electric City. Scranton!
30343 Dwight What?
30344 Michael The Electric City. Scranton!
30345 Dwight [pause] What?

30358 Michael Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
30359 Dwight Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.

30365 David [singing] Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.
30366 Dwight Impulsivity and inattention to detail.

30369 David Yeah!
30370 Dwight Terrible mistake.

30373 David Yeah!
30374 Dwight Undistributable.

30377 David Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...
30378 Dwight Impossible. He opened it like an ape.

30404 Michael Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. [holding up photo of him and Wallace] You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.
30405 Dwight Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?

30413 Michael We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?
30414 Dwight So excited.

30417 Michael Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
30418 Dwight Oh. Of course.

30453 Michael I don't know what they're made of.
30454 Dwight They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.

30622 Michael Hey.
30623 Dwight [looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under "confirmation."

30626 Michael You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.
30627 Dwight Could it be under "affirmation?" Cause you have thousands of those.

30630 Michael Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
30631 Dwight You did get the e-vite to my barbeque!

30634 Michael I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
30635 Dwight Michael...

30640 Jim Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
30641 Dwight Wait, I got it! Confirmation code[/b]

30646 Jo You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management?
30647 Dwight Thank you.

30686 Erin Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
30687 Dwight Hello.

30690 Erin Oh! [hits another key, they awkwardly dance together]
30691 Dwight I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.

30695 Gabe This is Accounting.
30696 Dwight Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!
30697 Kevin Hi!
30698 Dwight [entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.

30701 Gabe Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.
30702 Dwight Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?

30705 Gabe That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.
30706 Dwight Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.

30709 Gabe Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.
30710 Dwight It is not "farm boy swill," I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.

30769 Jo I think that's it. So we're all good! [many employees raise their hands] Thanks ya'll.
30770 Dwight [Jo leaves] I, uh...

30814 Jim Mm!
30815 Dwight [on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...
30816 Dwight You're twenty minutes late!
30817 Ryan [walking up] Um, I was at another dumpster!
30818 Dwight Just admit you lost track of time.
30819 Dwight Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
30820 Ryan Did you see Saw?
30821 Dwight Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
30822 Ryan No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?
30823 Dwight Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
30824 Ryan Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.
30825 Dwight I like where you're going with this. Continue.
30826 Ryan Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?
30827 Dwight I have an old barn!
30828 Ryan Yes!
30829 Dwight It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
30830 Ryan We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...
30831 Dwight Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
30832 Ryan Well suggest something else then! Don't just...
30833 Dwight He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
30834 Ryan Don't just criticize my idea!
30835 Dwight Think!

30843 Jim [on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
30844 Dwight The new IT guy. Nick.
30845 Ryan Nick.
30846 Dwight I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
30847 Ryan Like Frodo!
30848 Dwight Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
30849 Ryan Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.
30850 Dwight Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
30851 Dwight I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.

30864 Kevin Nice!
30865 Dwight You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
30866 Michael Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
30867 Dwight It's not really 1992 anymore.

30875 Erin It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.
30876 Dwight Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
30877 Nick Uh, yep.
30878 Dwight I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
30879 Nick No, I actually don't.
30880 Dwight Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
30881 Nick I think that you should call the cops.
30882 Dwight No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.

30891 Michael You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
30892 Dwight Michael, it's Phyllis.

30897 Michael And you guys are okay with this?
30898 Dwight She sent an email, so.

30908 Clark Yes, congratulations.
30909 Dwight Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
30910 Dwight Let's go!

30914 Clark Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay?
30915 Dwight No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!
30916 Dwight [as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!

30920 Jim Please do.
30921 Dwight [on the phone with a client] Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.
30922 Dwight This is where I saw that deer last week.
30923 Pam Oh, shoot.
30924 Dwight I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.

30927 Pam Kevin, you're such a gourmand.
30928 Dwight Right over by that fence.

30939 Kevin I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.
30940 Dwight Let's go!
30941 Pam Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
30942 Pam Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?
30943 Dwight I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.

30946 Jim Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon.
30947 Dwight [on the phone] Hey, what's up, kid?

30952 Pam Michael!
30953 Dwight Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?

30958 Pam Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on.
30959 Dwight Very well.

30966 Pam I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
30967 Dwight Ugh, alright. [as he puts a police siren on top of his car] Let's move! ... What?

30972 Michael Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car...
30973 Dwight Are you kidding me?

31005 Jim Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
31006 Dwight Dwight Schrute.

31011 Nick Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.
31012 Dwight Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.

31019 Kevin Really, really fun.
31020 Dwight Ha, nerd.
31021 Dwight I don't need a key.

31025 Kevin Yeah, me too.
31026 Dwight [with Angela in the break room] Bare my child.
31027 Dwight No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.

31031 Kevin Yeah.
31032 Dwight I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4

31153 Michael Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.
31154 Dwight Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...

31159 Jim No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
31160 Dwight Yup.

31165 Michael Guys, guys!
31166 Dwight Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this.

31169 Isabelle Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it.
31170 Dwight Have a seat.
31171 Michael Eleven pounds...
31172 Dwight Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun.

31175 Isabelle Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.
31176 Dwight Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
31177 Everyone Yeah!
31178 Dwight Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha.

31181 Isabelle Yeah...
31182 Dwight It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
31183 Oscar Congratulations. That's great.
31184 Dwight Alright. I'll call you, kid.

31187 Isabelle Do that.
31188 Dwight Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one[/b]

31257 Jim No, I don't.
31258 Dwight Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].

31277 Pam Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.
31278 Dwight Acceptable names include and are limited to[/b]

31283 Pam Hi. We did it.
31284 Dwight Jonas.

31289 Pam I used a variation of your move.
31290 Dwight Warf.

31294 Michael Andrew, what about you?
31295 Dwight Two forms of ID, please.
31296 Dwight Okay. Fine.

31300 Andy Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
31301 Dwight Nothing.
31302 Dwight Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male.

31306 Pam Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
31307 Dwight Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick... [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby] I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair.
31308 Dwight Yes you can.

31311 Nurse How we doing?
31312 Dwight It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after s*x, and then extremely cold for five months.

31472 Hospital employee Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?
31473 Dwight No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.

31492 Pam Okay.
31493 Dwight Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!

31500 Pam No, I mean, it feels... pressure.
31501 Dwight [as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] "We" don't.

31528 Clark It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful.
31529 Dwight Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!

31562 Erin Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
31563 Dwight Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.

31566 Erin I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
31567 Dwight Mega-Desk.

31570 Michael Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!
31571 Dwight Command central.

31574 Michael Drinks are on me!
31575 Dwight Surveillance, gaming- and business.

31578 Michael Oh -hoh! All right.
31579 Dwight Okay. Come on! Jim!
31580 Michael Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something[/b]
31581 Dwight Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.

31587 Jo Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something.
31588 Dwight What the hell is this?

31591 Michael Morning, honey-pile.
31592 Dwight This is not Mega-Desk.

31595 Michael It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
31596 Dwight That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.

31599 Michael Yes it is!
31600 Dwight Hello, Dwight Schrute?

31611 Jim No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.]
31612 Dwight Great.
31613 Jim No.
31614 Dwight Thank you. [hangs up phone]
31615 Jim No-no-no-no-no.
31616 Dwight Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
31617 Jim [swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
31618 Dwight They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!

31621 Jim Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
31622 Dwight Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
31623 Jim It is. Big time.
31624 Dwight Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
31625 Jim Pretty amazing.
31626 Dwight What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
31627 Jim Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
31628 Dwight I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
31629 Jim Is that what happened to you?
31630 Dwight I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
31631 Jim That's a common mistake.
31632 Dwight Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.

31684 Jim And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
31685 Dwight [Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
31686 Jim What?
31687 Dwight My headphones are broken.
31688 Jim Right.
31689 Dwight Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
31690 Jim Yeah that's great. Great.
31691 Dwight Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-"

31694 Jim [Whispers] Please stop that!
31695 Dwight "-But we'll be together then-"
31696 Jim Can you grow up?
31697 Dwight "-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then."

31766 Jo Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. [Scoffs] You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!
31767 Dwight Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles "Cat's in the Cradle" song]
31768 Dwight Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...

31775 Jo Sorry Sugar. What'd you want?
31776 Dwight Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.

31818 Michael [laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
31819 Dwight Oh [half-heartedly throws something]

31822 Michael In my condo complex.
31823 Dwight [surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.

31854 Michael I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
31855 Dwight Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?

31858 Michael [speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -
31859 Dwight Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
31860 Stanley When are we getting to sales topics?
31861 Michael Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read[/b]
31862 Dwight Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
31863 Dwight Hope - grows.

31866 Phyllis But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
31867 Dwight [drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!

31872 Michael Dwight?
31873 Dwight We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
31874 Dwight Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
31875 Phyllis Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
31876 Michael I would like your undivided attention, please.
31877 Dwight Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
31878 Dwight You couldn't handle my undivided attention.

31881 Erin [strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
31882 Dwight Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
31883 Andy Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]
31884 Michael Yeah.
31885 Dwight When I was asking about the leads.
31886 Michael M-hmm.
31887 Dwight ... is there any news on the leads?
31888 Michael Is that all you have to say to me?
31889 Dwight Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!
31890 Dwight Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?

31992 Erin Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
31993 Dwight What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
31994 Jim Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
31995 Dwight Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
31996 Jim [taps car] Lincoln.
31997 Dwight The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
31998 Jim [holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
31999 Dwight The leads are in?
32000 Dwight Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
32001 Michael Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
32002 Dwight Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
32003 Kevin You are never going to find them.
32004 Dwight Really.
32005 Kevin I'm going to enjoy this.
32006 Dwight [begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
32007 Kevin [muffled] I'm still enjoying it.
32008 Dwight Where are they?
32009 Kevin Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
32010 Dwight Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.

32013 Meredith It's coming off anyway.
32014 Dwight [dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.

32017 Toby If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
32018 Dwight [dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!

32034 Michael Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.
32035 Dwight I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
32036 Dwight [looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
32037 Michael You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
32038 Dwight Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.

32060 Michael [kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.
32061 Dwight Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
32062 Michael Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
32063 Dwight Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
32064 Michael No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.
32065 Dwight When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
32066 Michael Assistant to the managed him -
32067 Dwight Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
32068 Michael Yeah.
32069 Dwight Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
32070 Michael You think you would have done better without me? Really?
32071 Dwight I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
32072 Michael Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
32073 Dwight Kung-fu movies!
32074 Michael You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
32075 Dwight Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
32076 Michael That's my wife you're talking about, man.
32077 Dwight Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
32078 Michael If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
32079 Dwight Don't do it [lobs something at Michael]
32080 Michael No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!
32081 Dwight No! [lunges for a large wooden spool]
32082 Michael Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]
32083 Dwight [kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.

32090 Phyllis Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
32091 Dwight [Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.

32094 Michael Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.
32095 Dwight Not counting the last one, 25.

32098 Michael She can't talk to us that way.
32099 Dwight Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!

32102 Michael You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
32103 Dwight Okay.

32114 Michael I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
32115 Dwight And one girl push-up.

32144 Bar Manager What's your drink?
32145 Dwight 25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!

32257 Michael No, I got that.
32258 Dwight With this move, he can't get you.

32261 Michael I am in.
32262 Dwight Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah!

32265 Michael It's a deal.
32266 Dwight Sh-what?

32269 Jim Okay.
32270 Dwight No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!

32275 Pam They're both single, I have a sense they might-
32276 Dwight What are you-

32279 Pam It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
32280 Dwight Angela...

32283 Pam Hey, how are you?
32284 Dwight You're really putting me in an awkward position here.

32287 Pam Aw!
32288 Dwight Angela, not here!

32295 Kevin When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
32296 Dwight You are an impressive specimen.

32335 Angela And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
32336 Dwight Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
32337 Isabel Mm-hmm.
32338 Dwight What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
32339 Isabel A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.
32340 Dwight Ooh, I love repartee.
32341 Isabel Do you?
32342 Dwight Usually means there's a battle scene coming.

32392 Isabel Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole.
32393 Dwight Any brothers or sisters?
32394 Isabel Three brothers.
32395 Dwight Really?
32396 Isabel Two are in the Marines, one's a cop.
32397 Dwight Vegetarian?
32398 Isabel No. I love meat.
32399 Dwight What's your blood type?
32400 Isabel O-negative. Universal donor.
32401 Dwight Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]
32402 Dwight Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.

32414 Isabel [Isabel and Dwight playing whack-a-mole] You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?
32415 Dwight Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
32416 Isabel Whack!
32417 Dwight Extend the fingers more.
32418 Isabel Whack!
32419 Dwight Good.
32420 Angela This looks like a hoot.
32421 Dwight Hey, monkey, how you doing?
32422 Angela Whack.
32423 Dwight Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
32424 Angela Okay.
32425 Dwight Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
32426 Angela It's no worry.
32427 Dwight It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
32428 Angela I could see enjoying that.
32429 Dwight No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
32430 Angela But we signed the contract.
32431 Dwight Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.

32464 Erin Oh, I like his butt.
32465 Dwight Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.

32468 Erin You tricked me!
32469 Dwight [gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?

32472 Andy Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.
32473 Dwight I love that show.

32480 Jim Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
32481 Dwight That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.

32498 Andy I do.
32499 Dwight [hands Erin a basket of beets]

32506 Jim I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
32507 Dwight Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.

32594 Jim What's up?
32595 Dwight Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
32596 Jim Dwight, don't be gross.
32597 Pam No, no, he's right.
32598 Dwight Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
32599 Pam That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
32600 Dwight [removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
32601 Pam You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
32602 Dwight Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.

32645 Erin Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
32646 Dwight Yeah pretty much.

32656 Gabe Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
32657 Dwight Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.

32688 Jim And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
32689 Dwight [gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
32690 Gabe Great.
32691 Dwight [gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
32692 Gabe Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
32693 Dwight Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.

32708 Gabe Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] "Or cookies."
32709 Dwight What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?

32712 Gabe You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
32713 Dwight "I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit."

32727 Jim Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
32728 Dwight How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
32729 Michael Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
32730 Erin Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
32731 Dwight Guten tag, Herr Michael.
32732 Dwight I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
32733 Dwight I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
32734 Erin I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
32735 Michael La telefona.
32736 Dwight What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.

32739 Oscar Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
32740 Dwight Yes.

32745 Oscar "That's what he says?"
32746 Dwight Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.

32749 Angela Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
32750 Dwight I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]

32753 Angela [removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!
32754 Dwight Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program "print in all colors" initiative.

32757 Pam You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] "I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee."
32758 Dwight Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.

32761 Michael Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
32762 Dwight Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
32763 Dwight You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
32764 Hide Why? I don't need translator.
32765 Michael I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
32766 Dwight You don't know what you need. Just...
32767 Dwight If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?

32834 Erin Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
32835 Dwight What is this?

32838 Erin Great.
32839 Dwight It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
32840 Dwight Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
32841 Darryl I didn't say "a'ight."
32842 Kelly Thank you, Dwight.
32843 Dwight How do I apply?
32844 Dwight Oh.
32845 Gabe You have to be a minority.
32846 Kelly I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
32847 Dwight Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
32848 Dwight Gosh. He he.
32849 Gabe Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
32850 Kelly Because I never forget anything.
32851 Dwight Come here. Come here.
32852 Dwight Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
32853 Gabe Hmm?
32854 Michael You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
32855 Dwight Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?

32860 Donna You were right.
32861 Dwight One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?

32864 Donna You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
32865 Dwight Oh, man. White people, right?

32868 Donna I'm sor...
32869 Dwight Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.

32872 Michael [returns to office] What happened?
32873 Dwight I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.

32876 Michael Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.
32877 Dwight I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.

32880 Phyllis Oh, Michael.
32881 Dwight I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?

32884 Michael You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!
32885 Dwight You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
32886 Kelly I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
32887 Dwight That's not... she's... okay. Yes.

32920 Pam Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
32921 Dwight How as being a minority affected you?
32922 Kelly Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
32923 Dwight Oh, good, and you resent this because...
32924 Kelly Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
32925 Dwight Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.

32957 Ryan Okay...
32958 Dwight Hey... what are you guys doing?

32961 Kelly Oh, that is so good.
32962 Dwight You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
32963 Kelly Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
32964 Dwight Ryan? What does he know?
32965 Ryan It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
32966 Kelly Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
32967 Dwight "We?"
32968 Kelly When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
32969 Ryan And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
32970 Dwight Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.

33010 Michael What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
33011 Dwight Kelly is disqualified!
33012 Gabe What?
33013 Dwight You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
33014 Gabe Yeah, but she's not white, though.
33015 Dwight Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
33016 Gabe Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
33017 Darryl I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
33018 Dwight Kelly is the only applicant.
33019 Gabe Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.
33020 Kelly Namaste.
33021 Dwight Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.

33045 Andy There what is?
33046 Dwight Stop it!

33049 Michael Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
33050 Dwight You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!

33057 Michael I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.
33058 Dwight Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!

33063 Pam You have to settle down first.
33064 Dwight Michael, come on.

33067 Pam Okay. Okay. Yes.
33068 Dwight Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]

33093 Michael How about Thursday?
33094 Dwight Eel fishing.

33117 Michael Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna
33118 Dwight Are you nuts?

33135 Andy Make it higher? Okay.
33136 Dwight Oh, no.

33160 Pam Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
33161 Dwight [on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.

33164 Pam Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
33165 Dwight You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!

33168 Jim You do?
33169 Dwight No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.

33172 Jim But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
33173 Dwight If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
33174 Michael That's what makes it so wrong.
33175 Michael Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.
33176 Dwight Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
33177 Michael [whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
33178 Dwight I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
33179 Michael This is you. How much do you charge?
33180 Dwight $100 a day, plus expenses.
33181 Michael I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
33182 Dwight I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
33183 Michael Okay.
33184 Dwight And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]

33199 Darryl Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said "Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient." [smiles]
33200 Dwight [sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
33201 Donna Oh, hi. You work for Michael.
33202 Dwight I work with Michael.
33203 Donna Right.
33204 Dwight Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands]
33205 Donna Donna, hi.
33206 Dwight All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.

33232 Michael [sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]
33233 Dwight [at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time
33234 Donna Thank you.
33235 Dwight It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
33236 Donna You okay?
33237 Dwight Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
33238 Donna [chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
33239 Dwight Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
33240 Dwight [moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
33241 Donna Nope. I'm good, thanks.
33242 Dwight Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his "workout"]
33243 Old lady Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?
33244 Dwight Get out of my way. Huh!
33245 Dwight Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
33246 Donna I'm out of here.
33247 Dwight Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here[/b]
33248 Donna You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
33249 Dwight Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his "workout" and cannot chase Donna]
33250 Michael You're back. What happened?
33251 Dwight Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
33252 Michael No, what happened with Donna?
33253 Dwight Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
33254 Michael Ugh!
33255 Dwight Put your fingers here.
33256 Michael No. No! Are you sure?
33257 Dwight I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
33258 Michael Who eats eight protein bars?
33259 Dwight People who don't trust egg whites.
33260 Michael Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
33261 Dwight Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
33262 Michael What? No, she didn't say that.
33263 Dwight You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] "What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him." And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.

33376 Phyllis And it didn't change your mind.
33377 Dwight You were being really funny, and then you went too far.

33380 Phyllis Michael, that's awful.
33381 Dwight No, hmmm... that's still...

33402 Kelly 'Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
33403 Dwight Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it[/b]

33408 Ryan I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
33409 Dwight Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
33410 Kelly That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
33411 Dwight Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]

33431 Erin After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
33432 Dwight [pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!

33448 Jim [yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
33449 Dwight Leave, get outta here.

33452 Jim Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
33453 Dwight Right now!

33464 Darryl Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
33465 Dwight Michael, nice tie or something.

33486 Michael Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes]
33487 Dwight No.
33488 Dwight I could have stopped him.
33489 Angela Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
33490 Dwight Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
33491 Dwight Alleged contract.
33492 Angela No.
33493 Angela Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
33494 Dwight God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
33495 Dwight Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
33496 Angela What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
33497 Dwight So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse?
33498 Dwight Never mind. Just never mind.
33499 Angela I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
33500 Angela Well, it better work.
33501 Dwight How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
33502 Dwight Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
33503 Angela Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
33504 Michael [driving in car
33505 Dwight Eughh. [looks disgusted]

33598 Angela Same page. Go to the next one.
33599 Dwight Same page. Just keep moving.
33600 Lawyer Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix--
33601 Dwight Which we can't know.
33602 Lawyer This is essentially...
33603 Dwight Unless we're unplugged.
33604 Lawyer Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.
33605 Dwight And wake up in the future.
33606 Lawyer Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.
33607 Dwight What?

33610 Lawyer So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000.
33611 Dwight What?
33612 Dwight I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.

33622 Michael I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
33623 Dwight $30,000? There's gotta be another way.
33624 Angela He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
33625 Dwight Look, I will not pay.
33626 Angela Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
33627 Dwight "Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?"
33628 Lawyer Look, I don't think that's actually legal.
33629 Dwight Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela]
33630 Dwight Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
33631 Dwight But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
33632 Angela Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
33633 Dwight Fine. Five times. [signs contract]
33634 Lawyer Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution.
33635 Angela I want eye contact.
33636 Dwight No.
33637 Angela Yes.
33638 Dwight Do you understand how rare is that in nature?

33693 Michael Please.
33694 Dwight Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.

33726 Nick Hey Dwight.
33727 Dwight Hey, IT guy.
33728 Nick Mind if I get in there for a second?
33729 Dwight Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
33730 Nick Just one... [Dwight pushes Nick's neck to the desk and pushes his arm up] Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell?
33731 Dwight Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
33732 Oscar The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
33733 Dwight You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.

33740 Jo Okay Dwight.
33741 Dwight Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
33742 Jo Well, I'm inclined to believe you.
33743 Dwight Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
33744 Jo Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money?
33745 Dwight Are you referring to alchemy?
33746 Jo I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy.
33747 Dwight I'm not dumb. I'm smart.

33826 Michael Okay. You can count on me.
33827 Dwight [sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
33828 Toby I'm hungry.
33829 Dwight Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them
33830 Realtor [on phone] The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office.
33831 Dwight Basement office? You mean like a lair?

33847 Realtor [on phone] I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms.
33848 Dwight Okay.
33849 Realtor What time works for you? [Dwight looks across the street] Mr. Schrute, what time works?
33850 Dwight Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.

33858 Gabe Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
33859 Dwight All right. Sounds good.

33875 Kevin Well, I think that the real question is[/b]
33876 Dwight Oh, just...

33893 Nick You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name?
33894 Dwight Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and p0rn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.

33902 Michael I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.
33903 Dwight I'm about to buy this building, you know.
33904 Hank You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.
33905 Dwight Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.

33935 All Streamers! [everyone throws streamers in the air and starts dancing]
33936 Dwight Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]

33955 Pam [goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?
33956 Dwight From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
33957 Kevin Well, what if you're cold?
33958 Dwight Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
33959 Jim Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear.
33960 Dwight [drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
33961 Dwight Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.

33976 Jim Wow, that's a lot of keys.
33977 Dwight The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
33978 Jim That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.
33979 Dwight Where?
33980 Jim I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope]
33981 Dwight Give me that.
33982 Jim Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]
33983 Dwight Yes.
33984 Jim Go get 'em.
33985 Jim What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.
33986 Dwight [Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.

34011 Michael Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
34012 Dwight Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
34013 Gabe That'd be hilarious. Uh, "Jo, they're creating a hostile work environment. Stop 'em."
34014 Michael Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
34015 Dwight How close?
34016 Michael Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
34017 Dwight Yes. Of course.

34086 Pam Dwight is about to get so Pammed.
34087 Dwight Hey, did you SMS text message me?
34088 Pam Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.
34089 Dwight [as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting "door closed." What?
34090 Pam There we go.
34091 Dwight Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors] Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
34092 Pam Let's just calm down.
34093 Dwight Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
34094 Pam I don't-
34095 Dwight Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner]
34096 Pam Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!
34097 Dwight Well, don't look, freak!
34098 Pam Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!
34099 Dwight I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!

34148 Jim Great.
34149 Dwight How ya doin'?

34163 Gabe The alternative is termination. [Michael stares off, considering termination...]
34164 Dwight Wow. Late every day this week.

34167 Salesman We had a safety concern. Um... we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back...
34168 Dwight Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
34169 Dwight Good Morning!
34170 Jim Is there really?
34171 Salesman If he were in accordance with our dress policy.
34172 Dwight Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
34173 Dwight What?
34174 Dwight Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
34175 Salesman But the blood stained hands...
34176 Jim Aaah!
34177 Dwight It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
34178 Mose Aaah!
34179 Salesman I'm very sorry.
34180 Dwight You remember my cousin Mose.
34181 Dwight Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!

34184 Pam Were you painting in the dark?
34185 Dwight You made a big mistake. Huge!
34186 Jim Wait. Is this your place Dwight?
34187 Jim There it is. Alright.
34188 Dwight Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
34189 Dwight Aaah!

34194 Pam Yeah.
34195 Dwight [re-entering the store] I'll take the wizard!
34196 Dwight Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.

34199 Michael You forged them! You forged the forms!
34200 Dwight Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.

34203 Michael Yes.
34204 Dwight Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.

34207 Michael Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
34208 Dwight We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.

34211 Michael You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... [mimicking Gabe] "I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!" [normal voice] Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!
34212 Dwight No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
34213 Jim Prove it.
34214 Dwight What?
34215 Jim Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.
34216 Dwight Oh no, no, no.
34217 Jim But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.
34218 Dwight I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]

34225 Michael So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
34226 Dwight Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
34227 Phyllis The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?
34228 Dwight All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
34229 Ryan America is one big mall.
34230 Jim Did something happen Dwight?
34231 Dwight Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
34232 Andy Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.
34233 Dwight You don't want to know.

34243 Andy Dwight?
34244 Dwight What?
34245 Andy Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the "F" word?
34246 Dwight Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
34247 Stanley No you will not.
34248 Dwight Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're "appearance"ists!

34251 Jim Ok.
34252 Dwight You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
34253 Pam So what happened?
34254 Dwight I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.

34262 Andy No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.
34263 Dwight Ok

34276 Michael Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.
34277 Dwight Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
34278 Andy Pretty Woman.
34279 Dwight Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this s*x worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
34280 Jim No, no. I want to hear you tell it.
34281 Dwight Ok, Um... The s*x worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the "trappings" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...

34312 Jim Agreed.
34313 Dwight Really?
34314 Oscar Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.
34315 Dwight Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?

34319 Ryan Yeah, I liked them too.
34320 Dwight I can't see.
34321 Darryl Say stuff like, "Good morning, Good Afternoon". People appreciate that.
34322 Dwight Wait, I see you every day. Can I say "Good month?"

34325 Angel Please and thank you go a long way.
34326 Dwight Copy. Thank you.
34327 Angela Thank you.
34328 Dwight Please.

34347 Jim Wish us luck!
34348 Dwight Thank you.

34362 Angela [coughs for attention]
34363 Dwight What?
34364 Angela My place tonight. Wear this. [motioning to his new outfit]
34365 Dwight Do you have your card?

34417 Jim Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.
34418 Dwight It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
34419 Jim Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.
34420 Dwight Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
34421 Jim That's it.
34422 Salesman Let me know if I can help you with anything.
34423 Dwight Excuse me sir.
34424 Salesman Yes?
34425 Dwight I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
34426 Salesman I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about that.
34427 Dwight You work on commission, don't you?

34460 Andy Dwight?
34461 Dwight Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.

34470 Angela Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.
34471 Dwight Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
34472 Dwight Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
34473 Dwight Give me the punch card.
34474 Angela No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.
34475 Dwight That is not in the contract.
34476 Angela Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate?
34477 Dwight Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.

34513 Kelly Ooooh!
34514 Dwight [whispering to man sitting beside him] I work with that guy.
34515 Angela [after taking her gum out] Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.
34516 Dwight Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
34517 Angela Oh, Dwight, just move.
34518 Dwight [whispering to man sitting beside him] His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.

34534 Angela Come on, Dwight.
34535 Dwight Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
34536 Angela These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.
34537 Dwight Let's go.

34582 Angela That was more horrifying than Nunsense.
34583 Dwight All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.

34613 Andy Okay.
34614 Dwight All right, let's do this.
34615 Angela No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.
34616 Dwight It's okay, I smell.
34617 Angela No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.
34618 Dwight No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have s*x.
34619 Angela Well, I won't tell if you don't.
34620 Dwight I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... [Angela reaches into his pocket] Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it. [Angela pulls out hole-punch and punches the card]
34621 Angela Good night, Dwight.
34622 Dwight Good night.

34660 Michael No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.
34661 Dwight [driving past a line of Mexican men looking for work] Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! [man walks away] Que? QUE?

34678 Helene What did you think we were?
34679 Dwight I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.

34682 Helene I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show's ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.
34683 Dwight Hola, tu es une buena worker?
34684 Michael Jerk. [walks off]
34685 Nate Si, yo muy bueno worker.
34686 Dwight Michael! [attempting to get out of the car on the side in which Michael parked too close to a bush. Michael ignores him and walks into a building.]
34687 Dwight Y el accento, donde are you from?

34690 Michael Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
34691 Dwight You speak English?

34694 Michael Carroll, how are you?
34695 Dwight Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.

34698 Michael I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
34699 Dwight [nods to camera]

34702 Michael No.
34703 Dwight That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.

34706 Michael Weird...
34707 Dwight Poor hornet.
34708 Carroll Yeah.
34709 Dwight [looking outside through the window] I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...

34712 Andy I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.
34713 Dwight He'll die.

34718 Gabe I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.
34719 Dwight When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?

34726 Carroll It's a family room.
34727 Dwight Interesting choice...

34738 Carroll What? Did you have that while we were together?
34739 Dwight A bat! Impressive...

34757 Pam What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.
34758 Dwight [walking downstairs] Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?

34793 Michael No! It was like four years ago!
34794 Dwight It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.

34799 Kelly Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?
34800 Dwight I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had s*x with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...

34803 Andy You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.
34804 Dwight Fence with a hole in it..

34807 Oscar I don't even wanna know these things!
34808 Dwight The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.

34811 Michael How did this happen, how did I get this?
34812 Dwight The democratic primaries,
34813 Dwight Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
34814 Michael Oscar! Think abou- Think! [door slams]
34815 Michael You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. [in pirate voice] It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
34816 Dwight What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
34817 Michael Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
34818 Dwight You may have...
34819 Michael Oh my God! What if I did?
34820 Dwight You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
34821 Michael Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
34822 Dwight You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
34823 Michael There's no way I'm gonna do that.
34824 Dwight Then I will.
34825 Michael [makes grunt in attempt to stop Dwight. Dwight hangs up]
34826 Dwight No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.

34840 Michael Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
34841 Dwight So long Donna! [Michael hangs up]

34884 Holly Michael... [Michael hangs up]
34885 Dwight [to the camera] He forgot to mention the herpes.

34892 Jan Yeah. [singing] Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... [laughs] I love that commercial.
34893 Dwight I don't understand the reference.
34894 Jan Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.
34895 Dwight We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you. [Michael shushes him]
34896 Jan Are you gonna keep me in suspense? [Michael sighs]
34897 Michael [after long wait, to Dwight] Would you excuse us...
34898 Dwight Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.

34952 Andy Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.
34953 Dwight Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
34954 Michael You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
34955 Dwight Jan knows paper.
34956 Michael No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
34957 Dwight Wait, what Holly said?
34958 Michael Yes, I don't...
34959 Dwight Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
34960 Michael I know, I know.
34961 Dwight Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
34962 Michael Got it.
34963 Dwight TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!

34970 Michael Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
34971 Dwight Come on old lady. Let's go.
34972 Old Woman What is happening? [Dwight shushes her]
34973 Dwight Come on.

34982 Michael Look at that.
34983 Dwight Then make him pitch to you.

34986 Michael Nice!
34987 Dwight We gotta see what he's got.

34990 Pam Okay.
34991 Dwight Okay, and remember-you're not gay.
34992 Michael She is a beaut!
34993 Jim Stop it! It's gonna be great.
34994 Dwight Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.

35010 Oscar No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.
35011 Dwight Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.

35027 Meredith Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-
35028 Dwight Yeah!

35034 Michael [crashes into Jim and Pam's parked car] Oh, my god!
35035 Dwight Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!

35041 Michael I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
35042 Dwight How do I look?

35045 Michael Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
35046 Dwight Normal. Ugly.

35049 Michael I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
35050 Dwight Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
35051 Danny But from where?
35052 Dwight We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.

35055 Danny Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?
35056 Dwight Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.

35059 Danny Or...crazy.
35060 Dwight And who is this "the" Steve Nash?

35063 Danny I'm gonna go.
35064 Dwight No.
35065 Michael Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
35066 Jim No? Nothin'?
35067 Dwight No!
35068 Dwight No, Mr. Jock Hipster.

35089 Michael Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
35090 Dwight Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.

35093 Michael I know, I know.
35094 Dwight Crap.
35095 Danny I'm very upset!
35096 Dwight Danny Cordray is the worst.

35099 Danny More freedom.
35100 Dwight The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.

35103 Michael Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!
35104 Dwight Also, he slept with Pam.

35121 Oscar It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.
35122 Dwight I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
35123 Dwight Michael?
35124 Jim Okay, great-
35125 Michael Yes.
35126 Dwight Watch this.
35127 Dwight Can I talk to you about something?
35128 Jim -I'm just gonna watch.
35129 Michael No, you may not.
35130 Dwight [speaking loudly] So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest pen1s I have ever seen." And I said, "I know. That's why I brought you to the pen1s Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." Well, hello Danny!
35131 Dwight It's about this very announcement you just made.

35134 Jim [shaking hands] How are ya?
35135 Dwight Michael-
35136 Danny Good to see you too.
35137 Michael We're not-
35138 Dwight What are you doing?

35141 Michael Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don't leave. Don't let him.
35142 Dwight Like hell you are.

35145 Jim You hired him?
35146 Dwight He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!

35156 Oscar You are busy! We're in a meeting!
35157 Dwight Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.

35162 Michael You need the big guns, yes?
35163 Dwight Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
35164 Jim Yes.
35165 Michael Good-bye!
35166 Dwight What'd he say? What did he say?

35209 Danny Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.
35210 Dwight There he is.

35222 Danny Three of you guys for one sale.
35223 Dwight You snubbed her.

35226 Danny Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.
35227 Dwight Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too "meh" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? [Pam mouthing "I wear makeup"] We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!

35230 Danny It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.
35231 Dwight Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?

35234 Receptionist He's ready for you.
35235 Dwight Welcome aboard.

35239 Jim Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?
35240 Dwight I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
35241 Dwight It's after 5

35244 Jim Showtime!
35245 Dwight Pleasure.

35257 Andy [falsetto] I'll be your croak madame.
35258 Dwight He's not kidding.

35263 All Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.
35264 Dwight Oh.

35273 Kevin Nice.
35274 Dwight Jim talked too much.
35275 Jim No, I didn't.
35276 Dwight Yes, you did.

35287 Michael Oh, my god!
35288 Dwight I know how we can learn his tricks.
35289 Dwight What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
35290 Jim Is that your office?
35291 Dwight Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.

35300 Jim Nope. Different movie.
35301 Dwight The Sting. The Sting.

35307 Jim Meredith Van Helsing?
35308 Dwight Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.

35329 Michael Oh, no, no. No. Don't-
35330 Dwight People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.

35333 Michael Yeah, he is that good-looking.
35334 Dwight He's very, very handsome.

35357 Danny I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?
35358 Dwight Oh...
35359 Danny Well, we'll get this...[Meredith unbuttons]
35360 Michael Oh!
35361 Dwight Oh, man!

35366 Jim What do you mean?
35367 Dwight I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-

35397 Gabe Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? [explosion noise] This really make you think, Michael?
35398 Dwight [standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!

35413 Michael Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
35414 Dwight [has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.

35417 Michael Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
35418 Dwight To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler. [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.

35421 Michael Sorry I was a jerk.
35422 Dwight You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.

35441 Jim [holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound]
35442 Dwight Lake Erie.

35483 Phyllis I don't know, they're both handsome.
35484 Dwight Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?

35520 Michael I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.
35521 Dwight He went to Gabe behind your back.
35522 Michael No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.
35523 Dwight He went over your head to go behind your back.
35524 Michael What is taking someone from behind?
35525 Dwight No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
35526 Michael It was a good idea, though.
35527 Dwight Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.

35553 Angela This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.
35554 Dwight Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
35555 Michael [staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?
35556 Dwight Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.

35624 Michael Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
35625 Dwight Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
35626 Dwight I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.

35671 Andy Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.
35672 Dwight Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.

35675 Michael [having walked up to the front] Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on. [pulls the string to request a stop, makes a dinging sound]
35676 Dwight [rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...

35679 Guy Hey, is there a problem, you guys?
35680 Dwight NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.

35683 Guy Why?
35684 Dwight The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...

35687 Michael Stop the bus, okay?
35688 Dwight Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.

35691 Michael I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.
35692 Dwight Yes. I would welcome it.

35695 Michael Blah-di-blah!
35696 Dwight The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.

35721 Erin Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?
35722 Dwight [handing out cards] For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.

35761 Pastor Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance? [Dwight and an eldery man stand up at the same time, Dwight stares at him, man sits back down]
35762 Dwight Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.

35785 Kelly Try "Jesus."
35786 Dwight Opus dei.

35791 Ryan Hello.
35792 Dwight Shh, shh, shh.

35828 Girl It's gonna be three months of hard work and when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos.
35829 Dwight Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
35830 Michael [overhearing Dwight's conversation] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
35831 Dwight I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
35832 Michael Are you kidding me? Stop it.
35833 Dwight I'll call you back.

35881 Michael Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
35882 Dwight Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
35883 Michael No, you may not.
35884 Dwight Gah!

35951 Pam You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-
35952 Dwight [sighs] They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.

36012 Angela Are you going? [to Dwight]
36013 Dwight Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
36014 Angela I would watch that.
36015 Dwight Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.

36078 Michael [Pam in the background struggling with Cece] Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.
36079 Dwight Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
36080 Pam Maybe I should go.
36081 Dwight [continuing] Kelly. Kev- [to Pam] Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? [Dwight grabs Cece and makes noises, Cece stops crying] In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.

36106 Pam If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.
36107 Dwight That would be nice wouldn't it?
36108 Pam I can't even talk about it.
36109 Dwight You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
36110 Pam I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.
36111 Dwight Really? Oh... Then here we are.

36134 Jim I don't know about, love...
36135 Dwight She loves me.
36136 Angela [whispers in Dwight's ear] Outside my car in two minutes.
36137 Dwight Well something's come up, I have to go.
36138 Pam No no no no no! She'll wake up!
36139 Dwight I have something to do.
36140 Pam Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?
36141 Dwight I do. But you married my worst enemy.
36142 Jim Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
36143 Dwight Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
36144 Pam Absolutely! [starts out]
36145 Dwight From Jim.

36148 Jim What kind of pizza would you like?
36149 Dwight Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.

36163 Andy No! [runs off]
36164 Dwight [referring to the pizza Jim is offering him] Insert it in my mouth.
36165 Jim That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
36166 Dwight No, try me.
36167 Pam Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.
36168 Dwight I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
36169 Jim Okay... [puts pizza into Dwight's mouth]
36170 Dwight No. Crust first. [Jim turns the pizza around] Okay, now the beer. [Jim shakes his head no] Beer me Jim. [Jim quickly puts the beer into his face] Ssss. Gentle. [drinks the beer] Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
36171 Pam What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!
36172 Dwight I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
36173 Jim You need to stop talking.
36174 Dwight Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. s*x contracts exist!
36175 Pam Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!
36176 Dwight Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
36177 Jim [unbelievingly] Okay...
36178 Dwight You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
36179 Jim I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
36180 Pam No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.
36181 Dwight She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
36182 Pam The reverse cycling ends tonight! [Pam leaves]
36183 Dwight [to Jim] A single piece of pepperoni please.
36184 Jim I'm not gonna- [cuts himself off, Kevin walks in]
36185 Dwight What are you doing?

36219 Angela Are you authorized to do this?
36220 Dwight [lights and power go off] Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. [Turns On Flashlight and holds it to his face] Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.

36229 Ryan Michael, how's it going, bro?
36230 Dwight Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.

36233 Ryan Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.
36234 Dwight Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.

36263 Michael Tonight?
36264 Dwight Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z".

36267 Michael Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
36268 Dwight All Right
36269 Ryan Yeah. [Michael closes the door]
36270 Kevin Wow.
36271 Dwight And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. [crowd applauds] Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. [crowd applauds] And let's hear it for... Purebred. [crowd applauds] Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... [all three contestants begging for Dwight to pick them] Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King! [drowd leaves disgusted, as Dwight's worker claps]
36272 Dwight Yes.
36273 Dwight Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.

36324 Ryan I love it.
36325 Dwight Angela? [slides open the door] Angela! [see's a note on the door, reads it, and then crumples it up]

36347 Ryan Awesome.
36348 Dwight [out in the parking lot with a guy unloading hay bales while Dwight sifts through the hay] Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
36349 Dwight Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! [guy comes and sticks a Bale of Hay right behing Dwight and knocks it into Dwight] Watch it, watch it.
36350 Dwight Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
36351 Guy Don't forget to make a broom.
36352 Dwight Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2
36353 Angela Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.
36354 Dwight Roll in the hay, five dollars.
36355 Angela No, I meant... [motions you and me]
36356 Dwight Oh, our contract.
36357 Angela Mm-Hmm.
36358 Dwight Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. [looks at his watch] Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
36359 Angela Perfect!
36360 Dwight So, uh... [notices a kid walking on a bale of hay] Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.

36431 Ryan Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.
36432 Dwight [hits the back of a Dunder-Mifflin Delivery Truck with his hand] Hey kids, was that fun?
36433 Kids Yeah!
36434 Dwight All Right!
36435 Kid I wanna go on it again.
36436 Dwight Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks. [kid gives him three more bucks]
36437 Dwight Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
36438 Angela [waiting for Dwight at their meeting place, slams the door shut]
36439 Angela Where have you been?! I've been waiting.
36440 Dwight Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
36441 Angela No, I--I think you should make time for it.
36442 Little Girl I found the needle in the haystack!
36443 Dwight Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
36444 Little Girl I don't know!
36445 Dwight Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.

36526 Gabe Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?
36527 Dwight [picks up pencil between his toes]
36528 Dwight Hey Pam.
36529 Jim Why?
36530 Pam  Yeah?
36531 Dwight Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. [attempts to place pencil in pencil sharpener] Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes. [accidentally kicks items from his desk onto Pam's]
36532 Dwight Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
36533 Pam Do you mind?
36534 Pam I know, because you're the reason we're moving.
36535 Dwight I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
36536 Dwight Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
36537 Pam You don't have to do that.
36538 Pam Uhh, I think it's something like umm...
36539 Dwight [typing with his toes] D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
36540 Dwight What's the exact square footage.
36541 Jim [whistling, places cup of coffee onto Dwight's desk] Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
36542 Pam Umm, let me see.
36543 Dwight [lifts cup up with toes]
36544 Dwight How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
36545 Jim Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
36546 Pam Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.
36547 Dwight [spills hot coffee on himself] Uhh, aah!
36548 Dwight [chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say "Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is." I can't wait.
36549 Jim Well, A for effort right?
36550 Pam Mmhmm.
36551 Dwight [taps Jim's hand with his foot]

36564 Pam Fail. I don't want to fail... again.
36565 Dwight Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.

36584 Nate I wasn't here. [places a book in front of Pam]
36585 Dwight China is on the move?

36605 Darryl There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. "I'm coming over baby." And I would text back "BTB", bring that booty.
36606 Dwight Impossible, I love the law.
36607 Stanley Dwight, why is the toilet paper only half a ply?
36608 Pam Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.
36609 Dwight I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
36610 Dwight I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.

36613 Stanley Don't tell me how to do my business.
36614 Dwight Reply it!
36615 Dwight Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.

36618 Michael Yeah, I figured that.
36619 Dwight "Which is you" is not a sentence.

36626 Michael This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
36627 Dwight Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.

36630 Michael Here we are.
36631 Dwight Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.

36644 Michael Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
36645 Dwight [answers phone] Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
36646 Oscar That wasn't what we were discu... That wasn't the whole...
36647 Nate Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha...
36648 Dwight They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
36649 Pam [hangs up phone] Dwight. Dwight. Can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with, people he's worked with for years. His friends.
36650 Darryl [reads text] Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?
36651 Dwight You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity. [Kevin smiles]

36678 Michael I don't know what the [expletive] that was.
36679 Dwight I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.

36710 Pam Dwight take it down.
36711 Dwight [chuckles]
36712 Pam I'm serious, take it down or else.
36713 Dwight Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.

36718 Pam I went out to look for a better office space.
36719 Dwight Waste of time.

36722 Pam Yup.
36723 Dwight Let me see.
36724 Pam Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.
36725 Jim Yeah, yeah. Totally.
36726 Dwight You can't just move out.

36761 Andy Oh, its on.
36762 Dwight In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
36763 Kevin Well, I wish for a million wishes.
36764 Dwight Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
36765 Kevin Then see you later building.
36766 Dwight You can't possibly be serious.

36785 Michael I'm pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California." [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?
36786 Dwight Parley, my office, five minutes.

36790 Creed I understand it, I can't speak it.
36791 Dwight Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
36792 Pam You've been watering down the soap?
36793 Dwight Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
36794 Pam We need everything back the way it was.
36795 Dwight You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous... for stripping.

36817 Nate [riding in car, looking for new office] Ten thousand seven hundred and six.
36818 Dwight Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
36819 Nate Yeah.
36820 Dwight There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
36821 Nate The building's underground?
36822 Dwight She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...
36823 Dwight & Nate Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam.

36825 Nate Pam. Pam?
36826 Dwight What?
36827 Passer-by I'm Pam.
36828 Dwight Oh.
36829 Nate No you're not.
36830 Dwight I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
36831 Passer-by Oh, that's fine.
36832 Dwight So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
36833 Passer-by I've been known to bend the truth.
36834 Dwight Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
36835 Passer-by Okay.
36836 Dwight I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.

36875 Angela Zip it, Meredith.
36876 Dwight I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.

36881 Ryan Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?
36882 Dwight You are?

36887 Oscar I'll make it. What are you drinking.
36888 Dwight Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.

36985 Andy [singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.
36986 Dwight I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.

36991 Andy Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?
36992 Dwight You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.

36997 Darryl [on the phone] I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, [Justine hangs up] oh... pick a damn tree already.
36998 Dwight I'll take that as a no.

37016 Kelly This is a fast food receipt from April.
37017 Dwight Oh come on.

37043 AJ He smells awful.
37044 Dwight [mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.

37049 AJ Great.
37050 Dwight Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!

37055 Michael Hey.
37056 Dwight Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.

37064 Jada Merry Christmas.
37065 Dwight You apologize to me right now.

37070 Darryl What do you say?
37071 Dwight You apologize right now.

37076 Michael Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?
37077 Dwight Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.

37085 Jada A trampoline...
37086 Dwight No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.

37110 Angela We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.
37111 Dwight [turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally]

37116 Oscar Well...
37117 Dwight Oh, no. Oh, no!

37122 Pam Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...
37123 Dwight Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!

37128 Pam A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.
37129 Dwight Huh? You like that?

37133 Pam I'm sorry. I had no idea.
37134 Dwight Pam?
37135 Dwight Huh?

37140 Toby Hi guys.
37141 Dwight Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.

37153 Pam Okay.
37154 Dwight In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
37155 Michael Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
37156 Ryan We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.
37157 Dwight Death to Toby!

37174 Toby There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...
37175 Dwight Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a s*x slave?

37201 Michael What? What?
37202 Dwight I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.

37205 Michael Hold on, Holly's coming back here?
37206 Dwight With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.

37211 Michael That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
37212 Dwight Wait, what girlfriend?

37215 Creed She's one sassy black lady.
37216 Dwight I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.

37222 Michael I do. She is.
37223 Dwight Okay.

37273 Michael Well, then he's not a senator.
37274 Dwight Dear God in heaven.

37281 Pam Hey.
37282 Dwight Okay, hey, hey, hey...

37307 Pam Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?
37308 Dwight Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.

37384 AJ Oh, God, you look great.
37385 Dwight [voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.]
37386 Holly Oh... when did you get here?
37387 Dwight Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

37390 Michael Hey
37391 Dwight Ahh!

37394 Michael Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.
37395 Dwight [grunting, shouting]
37396 AJ Pleased to see you. Thank you.
37397 Dwight I have no feeling in my fingers or pen1s. But I think it was worth it.
37398 Michael Good trip down?
37399 Dwight [dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]

37436 Holly What's up?
37437 Dwight Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!

37440 Holly Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.
37441 Dwight This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
37442 Michael Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.
37443 Dwight Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.

37446 Michael And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
37447 Dwight No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!

37450 Michael It was insensitive and I am sorry.
37451 Dwight What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.

37454 Michael I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
37455 Dwight Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.

37458 Michael You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
37459 Dwight Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.

37462 Kevin Well, I am. [hugs Michael]
37463 Dwight And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.

37466 Kevin I'm going to help you.
37467 Dwight Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.

37476 Andy I said no hits!
37477 Dwight It was pretty awesome.

37494 Pam Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.
37495 Dwight Wow. Did your baby draw that?

37529 Michael Both sad.
37530 Dwight Gentlemen.

37533 Michael I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael.
37534 Dwight Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.

37539 Michael Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
37540 Dwight Yeah!

37550 Erin Do you want to keep this?
37551 Dwight Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.

37595 Pam Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards.
37596 Dwight Not doing that.
37597 Pam Why not?
37598 Dwight I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.

37610 Angela Ugh.
37611 Dwight Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... [sticks note card on board, makes trumpet sound] My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
37612 Angela Oh, God.
37613 Andy That's a good one.
37614 Dwight Yeah.
37615 Andy You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.
37616 Dwight Awesome.
37617 Darryl You know what you guys should do? Go to the bookstore at lunch. There's tons of cuties and it's easy to talk to them. 'Hey, what book is that? Cool, let's hang out tonight. s*x already? Whoa...'
37618 Andy The bookstore?
37619 Dwight It's that easy?
37620 Darryl I'll come with you, show you how it's done.
37621 Dwight Okay, I'll drive.

37652 Andy All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.
37653 Dwight I'll take the entirety of the second floor.

37660 Customer Hi.
37661 Dwight Welcome.

37664 Andy Why did we pretend like we work here?
37665 Dwight Is that what we were doing?
37666 Darryl Hey, how'd you do?
37667 Andy Good!
37668 Dwight Good. Real good.
37669 Darryl Really?
37670 Dwight Yeah, yeah!
37671 Andy We kinda nailed it.
37672 Dwight Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
37673 Darryl Cool.
37674 Dwight Okay. What'd you get?
37675 Darryl A book about oceans.
37676 Dwight Oh, really? What else? Let me see.

37690 Darryl Whoa! Hold on.
37691 Dwight I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
37692 Darryl [Dwight heads toward a strip club] Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
37693 Dwight Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
37694 Darryl I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.
37695 Dwight Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.

37698 Andy I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.
37699 Dwight Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.

37802 David All right.
37803 Dwight Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.

37842 Jim I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.
37843 Dwight Hey.
37844 Jim Hey.
37845 Dwight [to Erin] How are the marks?
37846 Dwight What are some of your small business ideas?
37847 Older guy I was thinking we could buy up of abandoned mine shafts.
37848 Phyllis, Stanley, Dwight Oooh!
37849 Dwight That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
37850 Phyllis A lot of mines in Scranton.
37851 Dwight Um, what about you?
37852 Younger Guy Uh, credit cards.
37853 Dwight Uh-huh.
37854 Younger Guy My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction.
37855 Dwight Wow!
37856 Younger Guy Something with cell phones. It's like, every time you make a phone call I'd make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents.
37857 Dwight Right. Okay? Great.
37858 Stanley Great.
37859 Dwight You promised us whales. These are worms.

37864 Andy What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.
37865 Dwight We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.

37980 Gabe It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some "Slumdog Millionaire" scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.
37981 Dwight So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
37982 Guy Well, I started my own golf supply company.
37983 Dwight [unimpressed] Really?
37984 Guy It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth.
37985 Dwight [quietly] Phyllis?
37986 Phyllis Hmm?
37987 Dwight Some of these people are for real.
37988 Dwight Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
37989 Andy Thank you.
37990 Dwight Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?

37993 Andy Excuse me.
37994 Dwight I got it. I got it.

38000 Andy Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. [to Michael and Holly] Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?
38001 Dwight [whispering] You're gonna blow it.

38102 Michael I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
38103 Dwight Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, "this way, this way"?

38106 Michael Sure we do.
38107 Dwight Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!

38110 Michael Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
38111 Dwight All right then. Someone propose a plan.

38114 Michael Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.
38115 Dwight Not you, Erin.

38118 Michael Yes I do.
38119 Dwight That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.

38124 Holly No, you can have your own opinion.
38125 Dwight Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling.

38225 Erin It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.
38226 Dwight Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.

38247 Kevin I can't wait.
38248 Dwight Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type[/b]

38251 Holly Which way did he go?
38252 Dwight Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
38253 Holly Oh really? You don't think he walked by the bakery just for the smell of it?
38254 Attendant She's right. He went that way.
38255 Dwight Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker. [Dwight and Erin low-five] Let's ride.
38256 Michael [at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk. [holding puppy] Do you think she needs more time or is it never going to happen? [licks his nose] I'm being serious. Seriously.
38257 Pam [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
38258 Dwight Has Michael checked in?
38259 Pam Oh, hey Dwight.
38260 Dwight I asked you a question.
38261 Pam No, he hasn't.
38262 Dwight Goodbye.
38263 Pam No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...
38264 Dwight Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
38265 Erin No.
38266 Dwight This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
38267 Pam Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...
38268 Dwight Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
38269 Pam Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]
38270 Dwight No word from Michael.

38308 Michael Okay. You've just lost my business.
38309 Dwight Hey.
38310 Erin Hey, you were in there forever.
38311 Dwight There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
38312 Erin She wandered off like an idiot.
38313 Dwight Hey!
38314 Holly Hey.
38315 Dwight What are you doing?

38319 Cell Phone Sales Person You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me.
38320 Dwight Tootenbacher.
38321 Erin Orville Tootenbacher. That's Michael's millionaire character that...
38322 Dwight and Erin farts popcorn.
38323 Dwight Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?

38337 Michael Well, I think I can get through the door.
38338 Dwight Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...

38342 Holly What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?
38343 Dwight Uncanny. Put a pin in that. [to waiter] Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. [pointing] This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
38344 Waiter I think he was heading downtown.
38345 Dwight He's heading downtown.

38432 Jim [getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.
38433 Dwight Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.

38436 Jim Big tip.
38437 Dwight Shh.

38440 Jim What?
38441 Dwight Just hush.

38444 Jim We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.
38445 Dwight Just rock. Shh.

38448 Jim Shh.
38449 Dwight Movie idea?

38452 Jim Um, bottomless champagne.
38453 Dwight Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.

38456 Jim No.
38457 Dwight Kevin! Do more stupid faces.

38460 Andy What's up?
38461 Dwight I don't know.

38464 Andy Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.
38465 Dwight Do the monkey face!

38468 Andy But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...
38469 Dwight Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.

38472 Andy Well, okay then.
38473 Dwight Go back to the monkey!

38476 Andy At least until Stanley calms down.
38477 Dwight Hurl your feces.

38480 Andy D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy]
38481 Dwight Good.

38484 Jim [on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]
38485 Dwight They really do that.
38486 Dwight Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]

38489 Erin [at vending machine] B-9.
38490 Dwight You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.

38552 Michael Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]
38553 Dwight My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.

38597 Michael I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
38598 Dwight Michael. Confession[/b]
38599 Michael Thank you.
38600 Dwight I've had intercourse in the office.
38601 Michael All right.
38602 Dwight As has Angela!
38603 Angela Dwight!
38604 Dwight As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.

38613 Oscar Just leave it how you said...
38614 Dwight Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
38615 Michael Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
38616 Dwight And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
38617 Michael Pro.
38618 Dwight Yes!

38723 Samuel [Dwight Schrute dressed as a butler. Speaks in slow, deep voice] Master Scarn.
38724 Dwight I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.

38729 Michael Tell him I'm retired.
38730 Dwight It's Goldenface.

38765 Samuel Oh-[starts to freak out, but the scene is crudely cut short]
38766 Dwight He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?

38889 Michael Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!
38890 Dwight No no, he's doing it to catch the president!

38893 Rapper [Andy rapping to a montage of scenes from the movie] Ahhhh, yeah! Threat Level Midnight! Makes all the girlies feel alright! From Madonna to Madelyn Allbrite, Threat Level Midnight! It's a threat, a level, a level level threat. He's the greatest hockey-star I ever seen yet. Threat Level what? Midnight! Threat Level who? Michael Scarn! Threat Level why? Apartheid! Gotta fight it, Free Mandela! Peace I'm out!
38894 Dwight I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.

38897 Michael Okay, go back to the annex.
38898 Dwight They're still good for another week.

38903 Oscar Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
38904 Dwight Hardy har har. Okay picture this[/b]

38907 Michael That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
38908 Dwight No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.

38911 Michael I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
38912 Dwight Could be.

38915 Andy No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
38916 Dwight I can see that happening, yes.

38919 Andy [watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.
38920 Dwight That's a realistic time line.

38923 Andy Let's not go crazy.
38924 Dwight Perhaps.

38927 Jim [using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
38928 Dwight I can see that as a very real possibility.

38931 Jim It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
38932 Dwight I can see that happening.
38933 Dwight [also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.

38936 Todd I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
38937 Dwight Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!

38940 Todd All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
38941 Dwight Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!

38950 Todd [shaking Holly's hand] Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
38951 Dwight He took my desk.

38954 Todd After you!
38955 Dwight It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.

38958 Michael Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.
38959 Dwight No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.

38971 Pam Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
38972 Dwight Why's he talking to Holly?

38991 Todd I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.
38992 Dwight [seething] Holly, you approved this?

39025 Pam [hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
39026 Dwight I didn't order anything.

39029 Pam Three. [Daryl nods]
39030 Dwight Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.

39033 Todd Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.
39034 Dwight I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
39035 Todd well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
39036 Dwight No it is not.

39039 Todd Check it out!
39040 Dwight I don't wanna move desks!

39044 Todd [grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don't even watch, Halpert!
39045 Dwight [in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
39046 Holly Oh, that's our Zen garden.
39047 Dwight What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]

39091 Kevin [Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
39092 Dwight Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.

39137 Jim [continues working]
39138 Dwight [walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
39139 Todd Why?
39140 Dwight 'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
39141 Jim That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious]
39142 Dwight Drink it!

39145 Jim So, this hot chocolate thing.
39146 Dwight None of your business.
39147 Jim Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
39148 Dwight It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
39149 Jim I really think we should join forces on this one.
39150 Dwight Really.
39151 Jim What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
39152 Dwight I know.
39153 Jim Here we go.
39154 Dwight Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
39155 Jim You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
39156 Dwight [mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
39157 Jim Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
39158 Dwight Who is Justice Beaver?
39159 Jim He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
39160 Dwight Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
39161 Jim Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
39162 Dwight Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.

39176 Ryan [walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
39177 Dwight [to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
39178 Jim Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
39179 Dwight They're all good. So good! Number three[/b]
39180 Jim One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
39181 Dwight Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.

39214 Holly Michael.. [they both laugh]
39215 Dwight People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.

39220 Michael In-grown hair.
39221 Dwight It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.

39224 Holly Mh hmm.
39225 Dwight The warmth will lure people inside.

39228 Holly Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
39229 Dwight This is how business...

39232 Michael And over here..
39233 Dwight I'm not closing the door.

39236 Michael Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]
39237 Dwight Stop it.

39240 Michael Let's go in here.
39241 Dwight Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?

39244 Michael This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
39245 Dwight Not so fast.
39246 Jim Holly, will you marry me?
39247 Dwight Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
39248 Holly No.
39249 Dwight I will trade you for the used candle.

39252 Holly No.
39253 Dwight Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.

39256 Oscar Will you marry me?
39257 Dwight That's how it's done.

39300 Kelly Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
39301 Dwight Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
39302 Kelly Screw you man. People like my stuff.
39303 Dwight People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
39304 Kelly You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
39305 Dwight And the Jennifer Weiner collection.

39316 Andy Sure.
39317 Dwight What is this?
39318 Jim How did those get out? I'm sorry.
39319 Dwight Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
39320 Jim I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
39321 Dwight That's a common swindlers trick.
39322 Jim Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
39323 Dwight So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
39324 Jim Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
39325 Dwight Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.

39368 Ryan My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
39369 Dwight You got this kosher certified?
39370 Ryan No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
39371 Dwight Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
39372 Ryan Thank you. Whatcha got there?
39373 Dwight Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
39374 Dwight things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
39375 Dwight Jim, put those away.
39376 Jim [pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
39377 Dwight just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?

39477 Jim [to Dwight] Nice.
39478 Dwight I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the?
39479 Jim Oh my God.
39480 Dwight That... that's impossible.
39481 Jim It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
39482 Dwight All right, I'll take them.
39483 Jim They're probably worthless.
39484 Dwight Probably. [walks away with beans]
39485 Jim Leave the telescope.
39486 Dwight I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.

39561 Deangelo Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-
39562 Dwight Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.

39591 Jim Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
39592 Dwight Thanks for meeting me.
39593 Michael Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
39594 Dwight There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
39595 Michael You know me very well, Dwight.
39596 Dwight That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
39597 Michael Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
39598 Dwight I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.

39692 Andy I guess this is my life now.
39693 Dwight How do I become a manger at Sabre?
39694 Gabe First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
39695 Dwight I left a message at corporate.
39696 Gabe Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
39697 Dwight Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
39698 Gabe What recommendation?
39699 Dwight From when he recommended me to replace him.

39723 Michael Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
39724 Dwight Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.

39799 Michael Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
39800 Dwight Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
39801 Michael Black tie optional.
39802 Dwight Every day is black tie optional!

39813 Michael So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]
39814 Dwight Always the padawan, never the Jedi.

39872 Pam Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
39873 Dwight [standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
39874 Kevin [walks in] Hi!
39875 Dwight Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!

39900 Oscar The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
39901 Dwight Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?

39928 Meredith [jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
39929 Dwight Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
39930 Jim I gotta go do this.
39931 Pam [annoyed] Why?
39932 Dwight Big smiles folks! There they are.

39974 DeAngelo I can just run over to the gas station.
39975 Dwight We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?

39978 Michael [in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
39979 Dwight I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
39980 Michael Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
39981 Dwight Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
39982 DeAngelo [as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.
39983 Michael What is your problem?!
39984 Dwight I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
39985 Michael Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
39986 Dwight And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!

40004 Michael Ahhhh...
40005 Dwight [walking up] Michael?

40008 Michael Maybe neither.
40009 Dwight I've got a treat for you!

40012 Michael Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
40013 Dwight Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.

40016 Michael N-
40017 Dwight [angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!

40020 Michael Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]
40021 Dwight What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!

40024 Michael Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
40025 Dwight Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?

40028 Michael Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
40029 Dwight Great idea.

40032 Michael Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]
40033 Dwight Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
40034 Dwight Yes.
40035 Michael How do you mean?
40036 Michael So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]
40037 Dwight Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
40038 Dwight This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as[/b]
40039 Michael Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
40040 Dwight [opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
40041 Dwight Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!

40049 DeAngelo I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.
40050 Dwight [smiles knowingly]

40171 Michael You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
40172 Dwight [to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]

40179 Phyllis [to Dwight] Do you believe that?!
40180 Dwight I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.

40390 Deangelo [holding two cups of coffee] There he is! Got ya coffee. [offers cup to Dwight]
40391 Dwight Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you. [throws cup in the garbage]
40392 Deangelo Not a coffee guy, I take it.
40393 Dwight It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
40394 Deangelo Listen. I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the People" on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want.
40395 Dwight I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.

40423 Deangelo You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's.
40424 Dwight Congratulations on your one cousin. I have seventy. Each one better than the last.
40425 Deangelo You know what... straight up, why don't you like me?
40426 Dwight I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay?
40427 Deangelo Ohhhh no.
40428 Dwight What?
40429 Deangelo Okay? I'm gonna win you over.
40430 Dwight No you're not.
40431 Deangelo Yes I am.
40432 Dwight No.
40433 Deangelo Oh yes.
40434 Dwight No.
40435 Deangelo Yes.
40436 Dwight No.
40437 Deangelo Yes.
40438 Dwight No.
40439 Deangelo Yes.
40440 Dwight No.
40441 Deangelo Yes.
40442 Dwight No.

40513 Deangelo Dwight, what's your take?
40514 Dwight What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all.

40532 Kevin Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
40533 Dwight [holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!

40545 Jim Nope. Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
40546 Dwight So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
40547 Jim Well, there is no inner...circle.
40548 Jordan Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.
40549 Dwight Really? Anything.
40550 Jordan Do you need anything?
40551 Dwight Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.

40586 Deangelo Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it.
40587 Dwight Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
40588 Deangelo Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper! [Dwight immediately gets up and walks out]
40589 Dwight Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership.

40598 Kevin Another one?
40599 Dwight No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.

40604 Oscar Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
40605 Dwight Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]

40612 Kevin Thank you.
40613 Dwight [on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]

40632 Angela Amen.
40633 Dwight Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
40634 Erin Ooh, about what?
40635 Dwight That's on a need-to-know basis.
40636 Erin I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
40637 Dwight [quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
40638 Jim Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
40639 Dwight Define foment.
40640 Jim You define foment.
40641 Dwight [clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
40642 Dwight [surprising Kelly] Aha!
40643 Kelly Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
40644 Dwight Gotcha! Why are you late?
40645 Kelly It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
40646 Dwight All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]

40662 Gabe No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
40663 Dwight [seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
40664 Jim Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
40665 Dwight You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
40666 Jim Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
40667 Dwight Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.

40671 Andy Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
40672 Dwight I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.

40687 Jim Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
40688 Dwight Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
40689 Jim And the desk.
40690 Dwight The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
40691 Jim Okay.
40692 Dwight Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
40693 Jim I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
40694 Dwight Don't make me fire you.
40695 Jim You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
40696 Dwight Don't make me pre-fire you.
40697 Jim You wouldn't dare.
40698 Dwight Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
40699 Jim [quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
40700 Dwight What?
40701 Jim If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well that's pretty premature to think," but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
40702 Dwight How you doing, Jordan?
40703 Jordan I'm good.
40704 Dwight Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
40705 Jordan Why are you telling me this?
40706 Dwight Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
40707 Dwight [walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
40708 Pam Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
40709 Dwight The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
40710 Andy Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
40711 Dwight The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
40712 Pam Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
40713 Dwight Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
40714 Angela Thank you.
40715 Phyllis You could put your cell phone in it instead.
40716 Dwight Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
40717 Kevin You could put a banana in it.
40718 Dwight Why would I put a banana in my holster?
40719 Kevin In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
40720 Pam Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
40721 Dwight Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]

40728 Kelly Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
40729 Dwight No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.

40734 Gabe I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
40735 Dwight Okay, why are you calling Jo?

40746 Gabe I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
40747 Dwight Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
40748 Dwight [enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
40749 Stanley We all saw you do it.
40750 Dwight Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
40751 Erin Navy blue. Little red anchors.
40752 Dwight I have no way of knowing if that's true.
40753 Toby I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
40754 Dwight Okay, really?
40755 Toby Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
40756 Ryan I felt terrorized.
40757 Dwight Come on.
40758 Toby Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
40759 Dwight I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
40760 Ryan Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
40761 Dwight Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
40762 Andy Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.
40763 Dwight There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
40764 Andy Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
40765 Dwight Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.

40770 Kelly Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
40771 Dwight American Idol? What? No.
40772 Kelly Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
40773 Dwight No.
40774 Kelly [singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
40775 Dwight Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.

40778 Kevin Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
40779 Dwight I put everything back in the vending machine.
40780 Kevin Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
40781 Pam You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
40782 Dwight Okay.
40783 Jim Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
40784 Dwight Thank God.
40785 Jim Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
40786 Dwight What's jazz hands?
40787 Jim [quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
40788 Dwight Fine.
40789 Dwight [leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
40790 Kevin [after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
40791 Jo Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers.
40792 Dwight Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?

40795 Jo Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs]
40796 Dwight [does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.

40808 Andy And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
40809 Dwight Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
40810 Kevin Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
40811 Dwight No, Kevin, come on.
40812 Kevin My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
40813 Dwight Kevin, not now.
40814 Kevin Hey, Jo!
40815 Dwight Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
40816 Kevin No, under the jacket.
40817 Dwight You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
40818 Kevin I don't feel anything.
40819 Dwight Oh, it's so wet.
40820 Kevin Push harder, Dwight.
40821 Dwight I can't. I can't push harder!
40822 Kevin Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
40823 Dwight Okay, how's that?
40824 Kevin Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
40825 Dwight I'm kneading it!
40826 Kevin Don't eat it.
40827 Jo Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?
40828 Dwight Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
40829 Jo What?!
40830 Dwight I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
40831 Jo Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
40832 Dwight It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
40833 Jo Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
40834 Dwight I take full responsibility.
40835 Jo Who else would be responsible?
40836 Dwight Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
40837 Pam You shot a gun off -
40838 Dwight Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
40839 Jo Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.
40840 Dwight Got it.
40841 Jo I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job.
40842 Dwight [on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -

40850 Jim Hey, Dwight. What's up?
40851 Dwight Shut up.

40931 Darryl I did.
40932 Dwight [clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?

40935 Andy [puts up a poster in the break room with "IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY" on it in bold lettering]
40936 Dwight Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.

40939 Andy The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
40940 Dwight Okay.

40943 Andy Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
40944 Dwight It's complicated.

40970 Jo Okay.
40971 Dwight They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.

40974 Jo Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. [Jo's phone starts vibrating, she picks it up and sees Dwight has texted her "Dwight's ability as a manager has lead him to higher levels of proffesional success,"] Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!
40975 Dwight Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.

41009 Robert Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
41010 Dwight [mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.

41013 Robert That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?
41014 Dwight [again] Assistant Regional Manager.

41017 Robert [more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face]
41018 Dwight [in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.

41023 Darryl [pats Andy on the back] Thank you.
41024 Dwight Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.

41027 Jim [Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
41028 Dwight [whispers] Yeah.

41035 Toby So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
41036 Dwight I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!

41039 Toby Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
41040 Dwight Yes.

41066 Jo It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.
41067 Dwight What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.

41070 Jo 'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.
41071 Dwight You can't.

41074 Jo How'd my girl Nellie do?
41075 Dwight No, it's not.

41078 Jo She didn't mention it?
41079 Dwight Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?

41082 Jo Integrity move. I like it.
41083 Dwight [standing up] Get out.
41084 Jim You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
41085 Dwight I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.

41107 Angela [limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
41108 Dwight Silence?

41139 Andy [grunts] Augh.
41140 Dwight Dwight Schrute.

41143 Jim So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
41144 Dwight You have to interview me...

41147 Gabe Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
41148 Dwight I demand more questions!

41151 Gabe Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
41152 Dwight Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.

41155 Toby I didn't think you were.
41156 Dwight What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.

41159 Gabe How many windows are there in New York City?
41160 Dwight Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]

41193 Jim Your department's just you, right?
41194 Dwight Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.

41208 Jim [while sighing] I suppose I am.
41209 Dwight [comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
41210 Kevin Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
41211 Dwight [walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?

41214 Kevin So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
41215 Dwight Good. They good?

41218 Kevin What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
41219 Dwight What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?

41222 Jim Yes.
41223 Dwight Peepa, how is she?

41226 Jim Okay.
41227 Dwight Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
41228 Dwight What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
41229 Jim No.
41230 Oscar Kelly's on your side.
41231 Dwight Now, listen,...

41234 Andy Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
41235 Dwight Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.

41238 Jim Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
41239 Dwight I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited s*x breaks for you and Pam...

41242 Pam A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
41243 Dwight Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.

41246 Pam No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
41247 Dwight Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back]

41250 Ryan I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
41251 Dwight Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.

41254 Jim Hey! Hey! Hey!
41255 Dwight Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]

41258 Andy She may have a point there... would a small pen1s work? Small-to-moderate.
41259 Dwight Okay. [looks ashamed]

41279 Pam Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
41280 Dwight We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]

41333 Jim He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
41334 Dwight I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]

41351 Andy [exiting elevator] After you my good sir.
41352 Dwight No, I insist.

41358 Kelly I can't get down.
41359 Dwight K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight's desk]
41360 Dwight Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great.
41361 Dwight K, I'm gonna need some help. Pam?

41371 Angela I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.
41372 Dwight Hoist him aloft. C'mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]

41378 Andy Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?
41379 Dwight Say no more.
41380 Dwight [starts attacking plankers] Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] â€˜Specially with me around.

41400 Andy Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no?
41401 Dwight What are you looking at?
41402 Jim It's, it's nothing.
41403 Dwight It can't be nothing.

41409 Jim No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
41410 Dwight [throws hard, Jim doesn't catch] Nice catch.

41417 Phyllis Ahhh! [falls out of chair]
41418 Dwight Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
41419 Phyllis Yeah. Yeah. Oh.
41420 Dwight ... 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up]
41421 Phyllis Thanks guys.
41422 Dwight Okay, which side of the list am I on?
41423 Jim Left.
41424 Dwight Yes!

41431 Jim Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
41432 Dwight This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here's something. Who would eat who in an â€˜Alive' situation. No... that can't be it.

41435 Pam â€˜Scuse me?
41436 Dwight Shhh, Pam. C'mon, don't be such a right-sider.

41466 Everyone [separately] No.
41467 Dwight No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here and left side of the list... ATTACK!

41472 Robert [enters room, everyone quiets and separates] I'd like to invite the following people to join me for lunch
41473 Dwight That's great. Let's do this guys.

41503 Pam That's regular pizza.
41504 Dwight You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
41505 Robert I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.
41506 Dwight Okay!
41507 Everyone [separately] Awww.
41508 Phyllis Well, what about the other guys.
41509 Dwight Losers.
41510 Robert No.
41511 Dwight C'mon.
41512 Robert I don't- I don't wanna say-
41513 Dwight C'mon, c'mon.
41514 Robert No, no.
41515 Dwight C'mon.
41516 Robert Ha, I guess I think they're losers.
41517 Dwight Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!

41530 Andy Yeah?
41531 Dwight Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it's over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.

41551 Andy Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word "no" not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.
41552 Dwight Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.

41568 Oscar Good night Andy.
41569 Dwight Good night.

41639 Andy This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!
41640 Dwight This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet....the Pyramid. [holds up triangle shaped touch pad]

41643 Andy Invest in softer cotton, sir. [tattooing begins] OW! Oh! Oooh! [Crowd cheers] oh, whoa!!
41644 Dwight So, you can tell your clients
41645 Dwight Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I'm gonna like it.
41646 Pam It's huge. How much does it weigh?
41647 Dwight DRAW SOME BLOOD!
41648 Dwight Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds.

41651 Robert Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he's all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.
41652 Dwight Fifty L.

41657 Robert There's something about an underdog that really inspires...the unexceptional.
41658 Dwight You're really going to want the booster.

41668 Angela Maybe.
41669 Dwight Thank you.

41676 Angela I already did.
41677 Dwight Is this really the best use of our collective time?

41680 Angela Fine.
41681 Dwight [to group] OK, let's look at some ties.
41682 Pam Fine.
41683 Dwight Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise.
41684 Dwight [To Oscar] Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.

41753 Andy Dwight, anything?
41754 Dwight We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house.

41767 Andy D-Bone. There you are.
41768 Dwight Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...? Lick the spoon?
41769 Andy No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about...
41770 Dwight Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don't see the point. It's so Wall Street.
41771 Andy I know, right?
41772 Dwight Right?
41773 Andy Yeah...um, how is everything?
41774 Dwight Good. Really really good.
41775 Andy Must be a tough time to be a family farm.
41776 Dwight Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
41777 Andy Oof. What are you gonna do about that?
41778 Dwight I don't know, what do you mean?
41779 Andy There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales...
41780 Dwight You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! [Licks brownie battered finger] And I'll do mine..... walnuts?

41829 Jim Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work.
41830 Dwight Yeah!

41863 Tattoo Artist So, coming out of his butt is a...
41864 Dwight ....back orders and you never called them.

41880 Andy Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.
41881 Dwight Uh, it's not totally empty.

41884 Kevin Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.
41885 Dwight OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
41886 Dwight OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. [Whistling and pouring water from bottle into sunroof of car] Come on.

41889 Kevin OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.
41890 Dwight There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.

41896 Darryl Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.
41897 Dwight I don't know.

41903 Kevin No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.
41904 Dwight Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey! [Oscar busts out back window, group cries out in protest, then cheers]

41916 Oscar Jim, he's not gonna star- [Dog lunges for open window and barks]
41917 Dwight OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.

41920 Oscar Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.
41921 Dwight It's uh, it's in beta testing.
41922 Dwight Nein. Sits. [snaps as dog calms] Goot.
41923 Darryl Let me see it!
41924 Jim Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
41925 Dwight Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.

41929 Phyllis Yeah, I lost my client.
41930 Dwight Yeah, that'll work.

41935 Pam We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.
41936 Dwight Bye poochie!

41947 Pam Oh..
41948 Dwight Before taxes.

41959 Jim I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
41960 Dwight I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] "Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug."

41989 Phyllis No..we don't
41990 Dwight I think we'll be fine. [group murmurs in agreement]

41995 Jim Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
41996 Dwight Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. [grunts] False. Andy, I will volunteer.

42017 Jim OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.
42018 Dwight Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]
42019 Jim Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
42020 Kevin Damn! [Dwight reverses pulling the wall with him. Erin screams. Dwight leaves forklift and begins lifting boxes by hand.]
42021 Dwight Yup.

42040 Andy Alright.
42041 Dwight [Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses]

42065 Jim There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
42066 Dwight Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
42067 Jim Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.
42068 Dwight [Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
42069 Jim I'd go with that.
42070 Dwight Like baboons or elephants.

42074 Kevin Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.
42075 Dwight Kevin! Doesn't apply.

42102 Jim Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]
42103 Dwight Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?

42113 Andy So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.
42114 Dwight Message in a Bottle, The Postman...
42115 Jim Kevin Costner.
42116 Dwight Kevin Costner.

42120 Jim So, it's not the dumbest idea.
42121 Dwight It's not the greatest one either...
42122 Jim But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
42123 Dwight And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor]
42124 Jim So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
42125 Dwight Exactly.
42126 Kevin I think we're ready to give thi- [Kevin slips on grease and falls] Jim?
42127 Jim Is he OK?
42128 Dwight Yep. He'll be fine.

42167 Jim Okay, don't be gross.
42168 Dwight [entering office] What's going on?
42169 Pam Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.
42170 Dwight Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
42171 Andy Yeah, Dwight.
42172 Dwight No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! [running from building] No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! [stopping in front of defaced billboard] NOOOOOOOOO!
42173 Dwight Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
42174 Ryan Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.
42175 Dwight It's simpler this way.

42204 Andy See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.
42205 Dwight And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
42206 Jim [pointing to computer monitor] So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view. [picture of Dwight and Mose on a see-saw]
42207 Dwight They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
42208 Jim Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
42209 Dwight There's so much more to it than that.
42210 Dwight I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. [holds up book, Throwing A Garden Party by James Trickington] Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars. [laughs]

42242 Toby It's a little tricky, you might have to... take... [Mose speeds away]
42243 Dwight MR. RYAN HOWARD!
42244 Jim Chapter 2 â€“ Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.
42245 Dwight STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!

42249 Oscar Wow.
42250 Dwight MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!

42276 Kevin [mouthful of food] I understand.
42277 Dwight Set that down. [grabs waitress] Present yourself.
42278 Jim Chapter 4 â€“ One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.
42279 Dwight LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!

42304 Erin I think we should toast...
42305 Dwight Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.

42344 Ryan That's because you didn't bring a jacket.
42345 Dwight My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
42346 Robert Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.
42347 Dwight Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
42348 Robert Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?
42349 Dwight I can get you exotic meats â€“ hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
42350 Robert We'll talk. [walks away]
42351 Dwight It'll all be goat.

42379 Jim I think I left my wallet in your house.
42380 Dwight Who cares.
42381 Jim Right here.
42382 Dwight MR. JAMES HALPERT!
42383 Jim Keys, keys...
42384 Dwight Stop forgetting things.
42385 Jim I didn't forget them, they're right here.
42386 Dwight MR. JAMES HALPERT!
42387 Jim I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
42388 Dwight What? Idiot.
42389 Jim Whoo.
42390 Dwight MIS... MI... What are you doing?
42391 Jim Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?
42392 Dwight That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!

42446 Kelly [Dwight walks in] Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?
42447 Dwight It's called a costume.
42448 Kelly What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?
42449 Dwight Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
42450 Ryan Whoopi Goldberg.
42451 Dwight Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.

42527 Bert Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm.
42528 Dwight Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
42529 Bert What are you, anyway?
42530 Dwight I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
42531 Bert If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft.
42532 Dwight Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
42533 Bert If you're going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl.
42534 Dwight Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
42535 Bert Yeah, she also has boobs.
42536 Dwight Yeah, but no nipples.

42567 Pam Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick?
42568 Dwight It's a root you idiot.
42569 Bert Everyone hates you.
42570 Dwight That's really rude. I don't tell you hurricanes suck even though it's true.
42571 Bert What do you like? Tornadoes?
42572 Dwight Try influenza.
42573 Bert Oh yeah? What's the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane?
42574 Dwight Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane's coming. I suppose you're going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?

42589 Jim [to Dwight] Are you serious?
42590 Dwight Yeah I'm serious.
42591 Jim That's funny. Ok.
42592 Dwight Loser.

42637 Jim Thank you.
42638 Dwight Go, get up there right now.
42639 Bert Got it.
42640 Darryl Dwight?
42641 Dwight You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
42642 Bert Unleash the hellstorm.
42643 Darryl Dwight.
42644 Dwight [laughs] Nice.
42645 Darryl Dwight!
42646 Dwight Got 'em. Go!

42657 Andy [Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic]
42658 Dwight Don't say cow- Ugh.

42675 Andy/Pam [Singing, Pam mumbling lyrics] Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.
42676 Dwight Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]

42698 Robert Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa. [tries to catch it with racket, misses, lands on floor]
42699 Dwight [runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.

42702 Jim Awww, sorry. Did it break?
42703 Dwight Wha...Yes. Your attention. Uh because... No that is all. [walks out]
42704 Robert Nah, it's good.
42705 Dwight Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted "We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.

42733 Jim Is that off again?
42734 Dwight They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?

42754 Jim Yeah. That does not feel good.
42755 Dwight I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
42756 Robert Okay. My serve.
42757 Andy What do you got?
42758 Dwight [opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh...should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
42759 Andy Sounds controversial.
42760 Dwight Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
42761 Andy Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.
42762 Dwight Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
42763 Andy Go do the voodoo that you do so well.
42764 Dwight I will do my voodoo.

42784 Andy And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call...Dwight...
42785 Dwight The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
42786 Andy If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.
42787 Dwight Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
42788 Kelly What emails are you talking about?
42789 Dwight Robert's favorite songs
42790 Kelly That's not that bad actually.
42791 Dwight P.S. We should should kill him.
42792 Jim Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
42793 Dwight No, it's an accountability booster.
42794 Jim Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
42795 Dwight Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
42796 Kelly Um, no we're not and you are a psycho who is ruining our lives.
42797 Ryan We can't do this Dwight.
42798 Dwight [Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile...nod. Smile and nod.
42799 Dwight They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like...not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor...
42800 Andy Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.
42801 Dwight But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.

42804 Oscar There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.
42805 Dwight [alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake.
42806 Erin Now we only have four strikes left until a home run.
42807 Andy Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I...
42808 Dwight It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.

42829 Andy Alright everybody, you are doing great!
42830 Dwight Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]
42831 Jim Dwight, question.
42832 Dwight No questions.
42833 Jim If this doomsday device goes off...
42834 Dwight Accountability booster.
42835 Jim If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
42836 Dwight I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.

42839 Jim Ok.
42840 Dwight How about Scrantonstrangler666.
42841 Jim Nope.
42842 Dwight No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha...You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.

42864 Andy Dwight we got five strikes.
42865 Dwight Really?
42866 Andy Did the email go out or...
42867 Dwight It goes out automatically at five P.M.
42868 Andy Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.
42869 Dwight Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
42870 Andy Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.
42871 Dwight No.
42872 Andy What?!
42873 Dwight You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
42874 Phyllis We did our best.
42875 Dwight No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!
42876 Erin You're a real crumb bum, you know that?
42877 Dwight Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
42878 Kevin Uh, the man tree puts its penis-
42879 Dwight Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
42880 Andy Nn no.
42881 Dwight What?

42884 Kelly Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! [erin joins in yelling] Shut it down! Shut it down!
42885 Dwight Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.

42896 Jim I'll try both.
42897 Dwight [digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?
42898 Andy Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-
42899 Dwight Get lost.
42900 Andy Well now hold on it, it-
42901 Pam What are you doing?
42902 Dwight What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.

42905 Pam Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]
42906 Dwight If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.

42916 Andy [to Dwight] Where you going?
42917 Dwight In. I'm hungry.
42918 Pam Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.
42919 Dwight Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
42920 Pam Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.
42921 Dwight This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.

42943 Pam Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?
42944 Dwight Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's "Nobody's perfect." Nice stroke, Pam.
42945 Pam No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.
42946 Dwight I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
42947 Andy Dwight, there's just a small matter of a-
42948 Pam You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.
42949 Dwight Any specific animal?

42957 Erin Who's calling?
42958 Dwight She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.

42961 Erin You're not going to take it?
42962 Dwight And she called it nuts?

42983 Andy Yeah.
42984 Dwight Come on.

42987 Andy I'm sorry â€“ I'm with a very important client. It'll have to wait.
42988 Dwight [mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my pen1s. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.

42995 Client Oh my God.
42996 Dwight Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?

43001 Andy She's not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.
43002 Dwight We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
43003 Erin This isn't one of those times. It's the police. They said it's the worst they've ever seen.
43004 Old Man You have to share the machine with others.
43005 Dwight Andy I'm really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
43006 Dwight [mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.

43011 Erin Line 2.
43012 Dwight Jim, are you serious?

43035 Darryl That stuff can come back to get you. It's called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle...
43036 Dwight [to old man] Okay, you're done.

43039 Pam Hey Cathy.
43040 Dwight Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?

43043 Pam How's it going? Everything make sense?
43044 Dwight Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?

43047 Pam Great.
43048 Dwight Yep, he's lying.

43056 Jim Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
43057 Dwight Oh we know.
43058 Dwight I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?

43061 Ryan Hey â€“ asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?
43062 Dwight Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.

43065 Ryan Yeah me too.
43066 Dwight Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.

43075 Darryl What are you doing with my lunch?
43076 Dwight It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-

43081 Andy Yeah and we're not about to make love. I just thought maybe you'd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.
43082 Dwight It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.

43087 Ryan So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.
43088 Dwight Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?

43091 Toby It's going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.
43092 Dwight But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.

43113 Toby You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It's a pregnant Helen Mirren.
43114 Dwight Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
43115 Oscar In this case yes.
43116 Dwight No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
43117 Phyllis No we're not.
43118 Dwight Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That's right. You're fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.

43158 Jim Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]
43159 Dwight That's just absurd.
43160 Pam Yes, because she's hot, right?
43161 Dwight Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
43162 Pam The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.
43163 Pam Dwight, am I hot right now?
43164 Dwight Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
43165 Pam What about before? Was I attractive before?
43166 Dwight Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
43167 Pam Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.
43168 Dwight You think Jim's lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.
43169 Pam Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.
43170 Dwight Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.
43171 Pam Yep, that's the Dwight I need.
43172 Dwight If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
43173 Pam Okay.
43174 Dwight Rule one
43175 Pam I think so. Okay.
43176 Dwight Rule two
43177 Pam Well, what does that... is that... okay.
43178 Dwight Rule three
43179 Pam Yep, good.
43180 Dwight We're gonna bust this guy.
43181 Pam Honesty is very important to me.
43182 Dwight So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
43183 Pam Let's just see how we feel when we get there.
43184 Kelly Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.
43185 Dwight None taken. What do you got?

43220 Kelly Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.
43221 Dwight I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
43222 Pam Jim's on to me.
43223 Dwight Hmm?
43224 Pam Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.
43225 Dwight Just ugly enough to have deniability.
43226 Pam Yep.
43227 Jim Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.
43228 Dwight Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
43229 Kelly I'm gonna write something mean on his wall.
43230 Pam No, Kelly, don't.
43231 Dwight The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
43232 Pam and Kelly With the crotch?
43233 Dwight With the crotch.
43234 Kevin [music plays] Whoo!
43235 Dwight Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed]
43236 Creed Who said that?
43237 Dwight Exactly.
43238 Creed How'd I get this long triangle?
43239 Dwight Okay, just shut it.
43240 Pam Is he puffing out his chest?
43241 Dwight I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
43242 Pam No. Maybe he just said something funny.
43243 Dwight Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
43244 Pam I think he's just making her laugh.
43245 Dwight Time for me to find out.
43246 Pam Why's he making her laugh so much?
43247 Dwight Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]
43248 Jim Dwight!
43249 Cathy Are you okay?
43250 Dwight I'm fine, I'm totally fine.
43251 Jim Dwight! Dwight!
43252 Dwight Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.
43253 Jim [to Cathy] Sorry about that.
43254 Dwight Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]
43255 Jim Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?
43256 Dwight I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
43257 Jim Leave.
43258 Dwight [to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft pen1s for nothing.

43313 Andy That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!
43314 Dwight Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
43315 Oscar Actually it is the northernmost.
43316 Dwight Ha!
43317 Dwight The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.

43326 Phyllis I'm in too.
43327 Dwight Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.

43371 Erin [to Dwight] Yeah, but I'm confused...
43372 Dwight Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
43373 Erin Mm-hmm.
43374 Dwight ...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
43375 Erin Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.
43376 Dwight Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
43377 Oscar Dwight, what are you telling this girl?
43378 Dwight The truth.
43379 Oscar Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay? She doesn't know any better.
43380 Erin Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.
43381 Dwight No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
43382 Erin Interesting.
43383 Dwight Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
43384 Oscar Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?
43385 Dwight Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
43386 Oscar he's a historian.
43387 Dwight Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
43388 Oscar Yes, yes, yes!
43389 Dwight Not by a long shot!
43390 Erin No!
43391 Oscar Yes!
43392 Dwight No, it was not!
43393 Oscar Argh!
43394 Dwight No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
43395 Oscar What?
43396 Dwight Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
43397 Oscar Erin-
43398 Dwight Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.

43413 Park Ranger Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most-
43414 Dwight Excuse me, I got a question for you.
43415 Park Ranger Sure.
43416 Dwight Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
43417 Park Ranger Uh, I haven't heard of that one.
43418 Dwight Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?

43461 Andy Alright fine. You know what â€“ I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I'm still going. And I'm not going to ask anymore. I'm not even going to look back. I'm just going to assume that you're with me.
43462 Dwight [Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren't going to look back.

43467 Oscar Dwight â€“ this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him.
43468 Dwight Really?
43469 Oscar Yeah.
43470 Dwight Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
43471 Archivist Schrute Farms did you say? That is a fascinating little chapter of the Civil War.
43472 Oscar You've heard about it?
43473 Dwight YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.

43476 Soldier Dearest mother I'm sorry it has been so long since my last letter. It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive. Melvin Fifer Garris.
43477 Dwight Hallowed ground.

43480 Oscar Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up.
43481 Dwight I've seen enough.

43509 Gabe Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. [in Lincoln voice] Oh Mary this is wonderful... Ok Mary stop your scolding. I'll be quiet. [aside to the audience] I need her like I need a hole in the head! [scattered chuckles from the crowd] [Gabe raises his hand with a finger pointed in the shape of a gun to his head] BANG! Ooh [Gabe falls to the ground and the crowd claps, Gabe picks up the Lincoln hat, bows, runs to the crowd and trades it back for his pink "DM does GB" hat and runs off]
43510 Dwight [knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
43511 Susan Answer the question, please.
43512 Dwight Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
43513 Jim [sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
43514 Dwight Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a suicide cult.

43517 Jim Yes. All right. Great. [leaves]
43518 Dwight Oh yeah?

43523 Andy Yep.
43524 Dwight That's right Jim.

43527 Robert [claps Andy's shoulder] Heh.
43528 Dwight [jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.

43531 Andy Hey, Mrs. California.
43532 Dwight No. Putting a load on more like it.

43535 Andy You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.
43536 Dwight Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again]
43537 Susan Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.
43538 Dwight [to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums]

43541 Susan Well, different circumstances.
43542 Dwight What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!

43545 Susan Who knows?
43546 Dwight Oh that's real creative.

43549 Susan Maybe after all this settles down...
43550 Dwight I could, but I just don't feel like it loser.

43553 Susan It's a date.
43554 Dwight Standing.
43555 Andy Hmm?
43556 Jim Ok.
43557 Dwight You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
43558 Dwight Don't!
43559 Darryl This doesn't help me. I don't respond to that kind of strategy.
43560 Jim Because you're sitting?
43561 Dwight Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
43562 Dwight Standing.
43563 Darryl Dwight, come back and spot me.
43564 Jim You know I have to do this.
43565 Dwight All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
43566 Dwight I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]
43567 Darryl To push this bar up.
43568 Andy [signing his name] Andrew... Baines... Bernard.
43569 Dwight No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?

43572 Andy Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it's like taking a test, but I know the answers.
43573 Dwight What do you want!?!

43576 Andy What was that?
43577 Dwight Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.

43588 Andy Alright.
43589 Dwight Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
43590 Darryl You don't have to say it if you're doing it.
43591 Dwight [laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
43592 Darryl Uh weight lifting yeah.
43593 Dwight Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
43594 Darryl I'll take a look.
43595 Dwight Your path from obesity begins right here!
43596 Darryl I've been meaning to join a gym. [narrating over a montage of scenes with him and Val] For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn't realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.
43597 Dwight Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.

43613 Jim Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
43614 Dwight Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
43615 Andy Jim?
43616 Jim Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.
43617 Dwight It's the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.
43618 Susan I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.
43619 Dwight That is true.
43620 Andy You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.
43621 Dwight That's me.
43622 Andy Dwight why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.
43623 Dwight Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].
43624 Susan Well make that a red wine and I'll tell you my animal rankings [makes gun click noise back].
43625 Andy Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now.
43626 Dwight Ready? What do you think?
43627 Darryl Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.
43628 Dwight You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month...
43629 Darryl Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.
43630 Dwight Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire]

43653 Andy We promised we'd never say goodbye.
43654 Dwight Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.

43658 Angela Enough Oscar, enough.
43659 Dwight Kelly?
43660 Kelly I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.
43661 Dwight That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.

43713 Susan Got it.
43714 Dwight What do you think you're doing?
43715 Darryl Getting my sweat on.
43716 Dwight I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
43717 Darryl I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.
43718 Dwight I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
43719 Darryl No.
43720 Dwight Eight minutes!
43721 Darryl Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.
43722 Dwight Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
43723 Darryl It's Lejon Brames.
43724 Dwight That's what I said.
43725 Darryl You know, get it right.
43726 Dwight I know.

43763 Jim Oh boy.
43764 Dwight This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
43765 Darryl Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.
43766 Dwight First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
43767 Darryl Okay, I'm not doing that.
43768 Dwight Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!

43809 Oscar What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?
43810 Dwight What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?

43813 Erin And...
43814 Dwight Where? Dark side or light side?

43817 Erin And you have any advice or anything?
43818 Dwight Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?

43821 Erin ...Help me feel better...
43822 Dwight Thank you, Andy.

43877 Andy What is all that?
43878 Dwight Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.

43887 Meredith No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.
43888 Dwight I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]
43889 Andy Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.
43890 Jim Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]
43891 Dwight [laughs while spray painting "Jim is Awesome" on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?

43899 Andy Oh my god.
43900 Dwight What is it?

43905 Robert Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning.
43906 Dwight No, absolutely not.

43916 Erin Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.
43917 Dwight [yawns, "Idiot" is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?

43920 Andy My ex is meeting my s*x....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your pen1s...that's just part of it.
43921 Dwight Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?

43974 Jim So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.
43975 Dwight [laughing] Boom!

43993 Erin [serious] Maybe you should mind your own business. [normal voice] Just kidding!
43994 Dwight Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
43995 Toby Oh my god.
43996 Dwight Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
43997 Jim I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
43998 Dwight Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?

44003 Toby No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.
44004 Dwight Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
44005 Jim Nice try, this is ridiculous.
44006 Dwight Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
44007 Jim Three times.
44008 Dwight You see?

44013 Jim OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
44014 Dwight Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
44015 Angela No. Porcupines don't have souls. They're like dogs.
44016 Jim [on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
44017 Dwight Come down right away!
44018 Jim [on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?
44019 Dwight Yes, I was quilled.
44020 Jim And what's it's name?
44021 Dwight Henrietta.

44081 Jim I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
44082 Dwight Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!

44099 All Aw!
44100 Dwight Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.

44104 Andy It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!
44105 Dwight You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.

44119 Andy Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.
44120 Dwight Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.
44121 Dwight Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
44122 Receptionist Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all?
44123 Dwight I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
44124 Receptionist Ooh. I'm glad you're on our team. Here, please have a seat.
44125 Gabe Dwight? What are you doing here?
44126 Dwight Gabe? You don't know?
44127 Gabe Course I know.
44128 Dwight Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
44129 Gabe Corporate says to me, "Gabe, we need you in Scranton." Scranton says, "Gabe, go back down to Florida. You're needed there." So, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I'm up there. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, I'm down here. I can think of no better way to confront my deathly fear of flying.
44130 Robert Dwight.
44131 Dwight Robert.
44132 Robert You made it.
44133 Dwight Yes.
44134 Robert Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. [Gabe laughs] Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly.
44135 Dwight Very good.

44169 Gabe [on the phone] You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right. [hangs up]
44170 Dwight Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
44171 Gabe Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question
44172 Dwight Meat grinder.
44173 Gabe [makes buzzer sound] Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.
44174 Dwight You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
44175 Robert Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.
44176 Dwight But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
44177 Robert No, he's going to meet with you later. No, no, no. I don't want you to rush it, okay? Trust me. Meet with Bill. He's a great person to know. I'll dialogue with him tonight. [leaves]
44178 Gabe CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.
44179 Dwight Still an important position. Still a chief.

44216 Gabe Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-
44217 Dwight [sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.
44218 Gabe Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.
44219 Dwight What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!

44236 Darryl Chill, man. This plan is airtight.
44237 Dwight So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
44238 Receptionist Well, you got my vote.
44239 Dwight Oh my God.
44240 Gabe I know.
44241 Dwight Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
44242 Gabe What?
44243 Dwight What's with the smile?
44244 Gabe You're doing great. You know, so good.
44245 Dwight And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
44246 Gabe Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! [Gabe makes a flushing motion, Dwight twists Gabe's arm] Ow!
44247 Dwight Take me to Robert.
44248 Gabe Ow! He went home.
44249 Dwight Take me to his house.
44250 Gabe Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.
44251 Dwight You know where it is. Lead me there.
44252 Gabe Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!
44253 Dwight Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.

44267 Andy So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.
44268 Dwight Which one is it?
44269 Gabe I don't know. All I know is the building.
44270 Dwight Robert! Robert California! Robert!

44304 Robert They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they?
44305 Dwight No thank you.
44306 Robert Sit down, Dwight.
44307 Dwight Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle
44308 Robert You were dining alone? All those people are you?
44309 Dwight Yes, exactly. Riddle number two
44310 Robert Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's basement
44311 Dwight N... it's complicated.
44312 Robert [holds a medal to the light] This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better? [holds out medal]
44313 Dwight It's a job interview, not a flea market.
44314 Robert Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.
44315 Dwight Yes.

44334 Stonewall Host Michigan. [Kevin holds up "A Mitten"] The President of the United States is "P.O.T.U.S." [Kevin holds up "P.O.T.A.T.O."] John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath. [Kevin holds up "The California Raisins"]
44335 Dwight Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]

44338 Andy [Erin swims up with ring] Wow.
44339 Dwight Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]

44342 Andy Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?
44343 Dwight Ugh.

44346 Andy Duh.
44347 Dwight Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.

44352 Erin Oh, you weren't going to do that?
44353 Dwight [Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.

44356 Erin Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.
44357 Dwight Thirty-two meatballs.

44360 Jim To madness.
44361 Dwight That idiot's been feeding us for a week.

44378 Oscar [Toby pours wine into Oscar's mouth] Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!
44379 Dwight Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.

44460 Erin Hey, Dwight Snoot.
44461 Dwight What-
44462 Erin What you doing?
44463 Dwight I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her]

44468 Erin Come on, don't you want to play?
44469 Dwight Oh really?
44470 Erin Yeah.
44471 Dwight Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]

44490 Erin [Dwight dunks her] Oh!
44491 Dwight [laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
44492 Erin Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.
44493 Dwight I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up]
44494 Erin [giggles] Oh Dwight!
44495 Erin [giggles] Stop.
44496 Dwight You stop.
44497 Erin No, you stop.
44498 Dwight No, you stop.
44499 Erin [to camera] Is he looking? [shakes her head] Oh. You can stop.
44500 Dwight Okay, you can stop.
44501 Erin No, no, no, he's not looking.
44502 Dwight No, you can stop.

44521 Darryl I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.
44522 Dwight [he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
44523 Erin Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.
44524 Dwight Damn it.
44525 Erin What is the most romantic possible thing?
44526 Dwight We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.

44530 Erin Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.
44531 Dwight Chicken fight!
44532 Andy No thanks.
44533 Erin Dang it! What the heck already?
44534 Dwight Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
44535 Cathy Okay, yeah. Who's going to be my partner? Where's Jim?
44536 Kevin I'm right here! [gets in pool] Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.
44537 Dwight Yeah- oh!
44538 Erin [knocks Cathy off Kevin's shoulders] Yes! Woo!
44539 Dwight Woohoo! Yes!
44540 Erin Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.
44541 Dwight I know. I could just bang you right now.

44569 Andy Yeah!
44570 Dwight [to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.
44571 Erin Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.
44572 Dwight Okay.

44576 Erin Mush, mush, mush! Come on!
44577 Dwight Go!

44585 Andy [muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-
44586 Dwight [coughs up water] Erin, did we win?
44587 Erin Sure. Sure we did.
44588 Dwight You're lying. We didn't win.

44592 Meredith Shut it, Angela.
44593 Dwight Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
44594 Andy Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.
44595 Dwight I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
44596 Andy Mmm.
44597 Dwight So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
44598 Andy Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.
44599 Dwight Not what I asked.
44600 Andy We're done. Erin and I are over.
44601 Dwight So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With s*x.
44602 Andy Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.
44603 Dwight [sighs] You're an idiot.

44641 Jim You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
44642 Dwight Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.

44653 Pam Oh, it's okay, sweetie.
44654 Dwight Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm."

44657 Pam It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.
44658 Dwight Not coming, have plans.

44664 Erin Ah! Angela had the baby!
44665 Dwight Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.

44668 Darryl Why?
44669 Dwight Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?

44672 Darryl Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?
44673 Dwight Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
44674 Kevin A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.
44675 Dwight You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-

44678 Kevin Oh, did I win the pool?
44679 Dwight -and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "I'd like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.

44682 Oscar Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.
44683 Dwight And then I inserted my penis-

44686 Phyllis Oh, I'd love to but, um-
44687 Dwight Into your-

44690 Oscar Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.
44691 Dwight v*g1n* and-

44694 Gabe Everyone, our very own Angela-
44695 Dwight Admit that there is a chance.

44698 Gabe Oh, I am so in.
44699 Dwight Admit it. Admit it.

44704 Jim Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
44705 Dwight Yeah.

44710 Phyllis Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.
44711 Dwight Before I go, may I?

44714 Phyllis Yeah.
44715 Dwight Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.

44718 Jim [demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.
44719 Dwight I just might be his father.

44727 Jim Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
44728 Dwight I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.

44759 Pam Jim.
44760 Dwight So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...

44763 Andy Hey, we'll be just fine.
44764 Dwight And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?

44767 Andy Oh, whew!
44768 Dwight See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!
44769 Andy Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.
44770 Jim Okay, wait, wait.
44771 Dwight Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
44772 Dwight Yes! Andy, get out here.
44773 Gabe You had something important to tell me?
44774 Jim No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
44775 Dwight Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
44776 Dwight I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
44777 Dwight Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
44778 Andy What's up, gangstas?
44779 Dwight Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
44780 Andy Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.
44781 Dwight I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
44782 Andy No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.
44783 Dwight I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
44784 Andy Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.
44785 Dwight I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill]
44786 Andy Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.
44787 Dwight Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
44788 Andy Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]
44789 Dwight That's good enough for me. [exhales again]

44801 Ernesto [pulls food truck up to where Dwight and Nate are standing] Where you want I park?
44802 Dwight Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]

44807 Nate Uh, I'm going to say "I" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of "he says blah, blah, blah," I'm going to say "I say, blah, blah, blah," but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, "He remembers Toby." [makes face] "I remember Toby."
44808 Dwight Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?

44811 Jim The empanada guy!
44812 Dwight No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]
44813 Ernesto No.
44814 Nate He says, "No."
44815 Dwight He says, "No!" Boom!
44816 Andy Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.
44817 Dwight Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]

44820 Creed Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.
44821 Dwight Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
44822 Andy Why? Everybody's heard it.
44823 Dwight Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?

44828 Andy His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.
44829 Dwight Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?

44854 Jim Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
44855 Dwight [laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
44856 Stanley What the hell, Jim? I covered for your bony butt.
44857 Jim Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
44858 Dwight Your clients. They're all mine.
44859 Darryl Jim, I got my ass chewed out because one of your orders got messed up. And Andy, you said you drove him to the courthouse.
44860 Andy Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.
44861 Dwight All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]
44862 Andy Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.
44863 Dwight No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
44864 Andy I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]
44865 Dwight That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves]
44866 Gabe [on voicemail] You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao. [beep]
44867 Dwight Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
44868 Dwight I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best

44884 Oscar Dwight. Hey.
44885 Dwight Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
44886 Oscar He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.
44887 Dwight Okay. [sits]
44888 Oscar Don't you want to see the baby?
44889 Dwight Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
44890 Oscar I promised I wouldn't tell.
44891 Dwight So don't.
44892 Oscar Angela got pregnant before the wedding.
44893 Dwight What?
44894 Oscar She got pregnant before the wedding.
44895 Dwight How long before?
44896 Oscar A month. [Dwight leaves, Oscar calls after him] You didn't hear it from me!
44897 Dwight Yes I did.
44898 Angela Dwight?
44899 Senator Lipton Dwight.
44900 Dwight I want to see the baby.
44901 Erin Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.
44902 Dwight Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.
44903 Dwight That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose s*x, that baby is mine.

44939 Pam Hey guys!
44940 Dwight [Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.

44956 Darryl Thanks. [to Val] Nice flowers.
44957 Dwight What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.

44973 Kevin Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.
44974 Dwight Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.

44977 Angela I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.
44978 Dwight So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.

44981 Angela Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?
44982 Dwight Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.

44985 Angela I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.
44986 Dwight It did, it did.

44991 Pam ...we wanted to say thank you-
44992 Dwight Oh, I like it.

44995 Andy Dwight, I have exciting news for you.
44996 Dwight No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
44997 Dwight What?

45000 Jim Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
45001 Dwight You can't tantalize me.
45002 Dwight [long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
45003 Andy Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...
45004 Dwight I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
45005 Dwight OK. [looks at watch and leaves]

45008 Ryan Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.
45009 Dwight If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.

45012 Ryan No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.
45013 Dwight Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
45014 Pam Alright [kiss]
45015 Dwight The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly

45034 Darryl Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a "we're just friends" beanie or a "I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'" beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.
45035 Dwight Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
45036 Pam Really?
45037 Dwight Mm hm.
45038 Pam I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.
45039 Jim Ooh, me three.
45040 Dwight Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
45041 Pam Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?
45042 Dwight God, you're such a spy.

45063 Nate [reading card] "I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day." Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.
45064 Dwight My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
45065 Kathy Kathy.
45066 Dwight Kathy.

45071 Andy You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?
45072 Dwight Yes.
45073 Andy Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?
45074 Dwight Oh my god.
45075 Andy They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.
45076 Dwight Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
45077 Andy Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.
45078 Dwight Oh god.
45079 Andy You have your team.
45080 Dwight Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.

45098 Darryl Back off! I got my reasons.
45099 Dwight May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
45100 Kelly Why?
45101 Dwight Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
45102 Kelly Hell yeah.
45103 Stanley What?!
45104 Dwight Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
45105 Meredith Wait. Kathy gets to go? Uh, why does she even still work here? Pam is back.
45106 Oscar It just feels like a slap in the face.
45107 Dwight I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
45108 Oscar We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.
45109 Dwight I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
45110 Kevin Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.
45111 Dwight Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
45112 Ryan What are the criteria for going?
45113 Dwight It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
45114 Andy Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs]
45115 Dwight Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?

45121 Angela My baby is not a monster!
45122 Dwight Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.

45131 Andy Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.
45132 Dwight OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.

45135 Andy OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.
45136 Dwight Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.

45139 Andy Five to six hours?
45140 Dwight Three to four hours.
45141 Andy No no no no.
45142 Dwight Two to three hours...
45143 Andy Nope.
45144 Dwight Come up with a statement in the next hour....

45156 Meredith I am...
45157 Dwight I have already picked my team

45161 Andy Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.
45162 Dwight Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
45163 Kevin Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...
45164 Dwight Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.

45168 Toby It has been a long, lonely winter.
45169 Dwight Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA

45172 Stanley Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.
45173 Dwight Maybe it's what she does here...

45177 Erin I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.
45178 Dwight You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.

45189 Pam Exactly.
45190 Dwight Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
45191 Andy Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.
45192 Dwight I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
45193 Jim You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
45194 Dwight Jim is essential to th-
45195 Jim Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]
45196 Dwight Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
45197 Jim Essential.
45198 Dwight This is stupid! Cut.
45199 Jim Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.
45200 Dwight He doesn't even want to go.
45201 Jim Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
45202 Dwight Oh my god.
45203 Jim Hey, quick question
45204 Andy OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida
45205 Dwight What?
45206 Andy ....Stanley..
45207 Dwight No.
45208 Andy ...Ryan...
45209 Dwight No!
45210 Andy ...Erin...
45211 Dwight (Bleep)
45212 Andy ...And, Jim.
45213 Dwight You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
45214 Dwight Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
45215 Stanley Why is it so hot in here?
45216 Dwight Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
45217 Ryan But...
45218 Dwight But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
45219 Ryan No no, I want to go.
45220 Dwight Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]
45221 Jim Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
45222 Dwight SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
45223 Dwight How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
45224 Stanley How did a mosquito get in here?
45225 Dwight I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]
45226 Dwight Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says "I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt" unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?
45227 Dwight Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
45228 Erin I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
45229 Dwight Wake up! [Cathy screams]
45230 Dwight Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! [Erin kicks him] Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
45231 Erin Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.
45232 Dwight Stanley! Wake up! You've got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
45233 Erin Stanley, wake up, it's pretzel day! [Dwight pinches Stanley's nose and covers his mouth]
45234 Stanley Mmm! [struggles] Ugh!
45235 Dwight [lets go] Good morning.

45238 Jim I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh- [hears door, hides]
45239 Dwight Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? [sees trashed room] Oh man.
45240 Erin What do you think happened?
45241 Dwight Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. [sees "IT WAS DWIGHT" written in lipstick on the door] Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh. [Jim falls out of the closet, Erin and Dwight scream]

45244 Jim Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
45245 Dwight Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
45246 Dwight I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.
45247 Dwight I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
45248 Saleswoman What does he like?
45249 Dwight Power.
45250 Ryan Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't see too many museums around here."
45251 Dwight Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
45252 Erin Hey, are you okay?
45253 Dwight I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
45254 Erin Who says none of us are diarrheal?
45255 Jim Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
45256 Dwight Very funny, Jim.
45257 Jim Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
45258 Dwight I'm gonna set your face on fire.

45297 Packer Still queer?
45298 Dwight Packer.

45315 Nellie Let me just get the projector working.
45316 Dwight Uh. [eats antacids]
45317 Jim You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
45318 Dwight You didn't poison me, it's just stress.
45319 Jim Okay.
45320 Dwight What is the antidote?
45321 Jim True love's kiss.
45322 Nellie Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. [points to Ryan] You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.
45323 Dwight I'll do it! I always say, "You want something done right? Ask Dwight." Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head. [reaches up, whimpers]
45324 Packer I can do it.
45325 Dwight Mmm! [screams, pulls down screen] There we go.
45326 Dwight [on phone] Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. [to Jim] What kind of poison did you use?
45327 Jim Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
45328 Dwight Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. [sees chart on screen] Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
45329 Nellie Is there not? Maybe I'm just waiting for someone to wow me. [winks]
45330 Emergency Operator Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?
45331 Dwight Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.

45334 Packer Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.
45335 Dwight You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
45336 Packer Did you say "masturbator?"
45337 Dwight I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
45338 Nellie Why are you sitting down like that?
45339 Dwight Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!

45355 Nellie I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.
45356 Dwight I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
45357 Ryan Dude, I think you have appendicitis.
45358 Dwight [tries to climb human pyramid] Ahh!
45359 Ryan Dwight?
45360 Jim Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
45361 Dwight Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
45362 Packer Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.
45363 Dwight [groans] Stop moving!
45364 Jim No one's moving!
45365 Dwight Oh! [collapses]
45366 Everyone Oh, oh! [general commotion]
45367 Dwight Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.

45373 Paramedic Two or three days.
45374 Dwight Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
45375 Packer Drama queen, am I right?
45376 Dwight [to phone] Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. [presses button] Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.

45387 Andy I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. [phone rings] Oh, there's the phone!
45388 Dwight I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
45389 Erin Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.
45390 Dwight Who's doing the presentations?
45391 Erin Packer's giving one. [Dwight growls] Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.
45392 Dwight Damn it!

45395 Nellie Very good point.
45396 Dwight Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
45397 Nellie Dwight, are you all right?
45398 Dwight I'm great. How are you?
45399 Dwight What's our presentation about?
45400 Jim Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
45401 Dwight I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
45402 Erin Do a hundred jumping jacks.
45403 Dwight No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
45404 Erin I don't feel like it either!
45405 Erin [doing jumping jacks] Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-
45406 Dwight I want that vice-presidency.
45407 Jim You haven't done any of the research.
45408 Dwight "You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name." You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.

45411 Stanley Yup.
45412 Dwight All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
45413 Nellie Ah, what is your topic?
45414 Dwight What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
45415 Erin Retail consumer habits.
45416 Dwight Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
45417 Dwight Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
45418 Ryan I can field this one.
45419 Dwight No, sit down. "Seasonal." Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. [Jim gives Dwight a bowl of ice chips] Thank you. [Dwight sticks his head in the bowl] Oh, God. Next slide.
45420 Andy Mail call! [sings] His name is Oscar, and he got some mail, and he better open it, or go to jail 'cause it's your taxes. His name is Kevin, and no mail for him, but he got a coupon, for some frozen... yogurt.
45421 Kevin Are those the lyrics?
45422 Dwight Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
45423 Nellie What are the three pillars of retail?
45424 Erin [whispers] Convenience.
45425 Dwight Ingredients.
45426 Erin Service.
45427 Dwight Burgers.
45428 Erin Building loyalty.
45429 Dwight Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one
45430 Nellie Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.
45431 Dwight Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
45432 Jim You are bleeding through your shirt.
45433 Dwight Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. [ties jacket around wound] Ah.

45443 Nellie How are you feeling?
45444 Dwight Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
45445 Nellie Can I see the wound?
45446 Dwight [show her the wound] Oh God.
45447 Nellie Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.
45448 Dwight You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
45449 Nellie A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.
45450 Dwight That's right.
45451 Nellie That is amazing. Todd, look at that.
45452 Packer Oh, yikes. Incoming- [tries to touch the wound]
45453 Dwight Ah! Not so fast.
45454 Nellie Would you come in early tomorrow so we can talk about the store over breakfast? I feel you [points to both] have a lot to offer.
45455 Packer It would be an honor, ma'am.
45456 Dwight I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
45457 Dwight I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.

45472 Pam Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
45473 Dwight We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa.

45479 Angela News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
45480 Dwight Nope, I wasn't bitten.

45483 Angela That is where we disagree.
45484 Dwight Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.

45487 Pam No, three-month-old humans don't do that.
45488 Dwight If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.

45491 Pam Angela is such a liar!
45492 Dwight No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.

45495 Oscar Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
45496 Dwight No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.

45499 Angela No one said "you must have two"
45500 Dwight Such a chorus girl.

45511 Packer That's great.
45512 Dwight Euughh... Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present... Hey.
45513 Dwight Pretty good.

45516 Jim Hmm? No.
45517 Dwight [laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.

45520 Jim Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
45521 Dwight Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-

45524 Jim um... I mean-
45525 Dwight That's a hobby, unless it's for food.

45528 Jim I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
45529 Dwight Waste of time.

45532 Jim Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just... we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
45533 Dwight That's just a verb.

45536 Jim [Jim Face]
45537 Dwight Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.

45542 Andy Play it cool, man. She'll come around.
45543 Dwight English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.

45581 Andy Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
45582 Dwight Okay... Seven, one, one, nine...

45585 Andy ...ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
45586 Dwight No, okay.

45589 Nellie Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
45590 Dwight Try again... Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one... is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
45591 Dwight Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ... What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
45592 Nellie Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
45593 Packer Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.
45594 Dwight [gasps]Wait, the numbers!
45595 Dwight That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
45596 Nellie Mm-hmm.
45597 Gabe What happens if you're the hunchback?
45598 Dwight oh...
45599 Dwight Oh, you get kicked.
45600 Nellie mm-hmm...
45601 Jim How many buttons do you have?
45602 Dwight There you go.
45603 Dwight (takes out bag) 40. Always.
45604 Nellie I will see you in seven-
45605 Cathy Can I see?
45606 Dwight Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]... Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
45607 Dwight Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
45608 Dwight [in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
45609 Cathy So, I get to kick you now.
45610 Angela 1434-967, paid.
45611 Dwight No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.

45616 Pam That's it, last one.
45617 Dwight Aah!

45640 Ryan Oh, no, I didn't know.
45641 Dwight [wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?

45644 Ryan You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
45645 Dwight [sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back!

45648 Erin Hey.
45649 Dwight [continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!

45660 Kelly I'm dying!
45661 Dwight I think I saw it!

45666 Kelly Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
45667 Dwight You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.

45670 Packer I will be here.
45671 Dwight Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
45672 Dwight Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.

45675 Nellie [at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
45676 Dwight Well, saddles... [clicks tongue, whinnies] ... sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
45677 Jim [whispers] Is that Nellie?
45678 Packer What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.
45679 Dwight [whispers] Don't let-shh!
45680 Dwight If anyone's having s*x with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.

45705 Nellie Like I'm on the beach.
45706 Dwight [imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls]

45720 Nellie Impressive.
45721 Dwight Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]

45774 Nellie You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
45775 Dwight You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] ...ahhmmm... excuse me... What?! Not now, I'm busy.
45776 Jim [on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
45777 Dwight Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no... Freak, I need a favor.
45778 Gabe Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
45779 Dwight I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
45780 Gabe What's in it for GSL?
45781 Dwight You really want Packer as your boss?
45782 Gabe Got it.
45783 Dwight If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
45784 Dwight Where did you see it?
45785 Jim In the bed.
45786 Cathy I haven't seen anything.
45787 Dwight We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
45788 Cathy Jeez...
45789 Dwight Describe it.
45790 Jim Brown, shiny, painful bite.
45791 Dwight Could be a bat weevil... Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
45792 Jim Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
45793 Dwight Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
45794 Jim So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
45795 Dwight Pshh. That's a bedbug.
45796 Jim Yeah.
45797 Dwight Everything's a joke.
45798 Jim I know.
45799 Dwight Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair]
45800 Jim Ow.
45801 Dwight God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
45802 Jim Just check it.
45803 Dwight You are clean. Okay... One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
45804 Jim Alright.
45805 Dwight Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me!
45806 Cathy Is this really nessecary?
45807 Jim He knows what he's doing.
45808 Dwight Let the bedbugs bite!
45809 Cathy Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
45810 Jim Alright, then I will catch you later... What do we do now?
45811 Dwight Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.

45814 Kelly You think you're so pretty!  Well you're not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
45815 Dwight Yes.

45818 Kelly Take that!  Not so pre-violent anymore!
45819 Dwight Yes. Yes.

45822 Andy Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!
45823 Dwight We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.

45829 Nellie Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ... what's lower than dirt?
45830 Dwight Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it.  We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
45831 Dwight Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
45832 Nellie Dwight.  You're the vice president.
45833 Nellie Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn't even get a callback.
45834 Dwight Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!

45837 Nellie The black one. I never stood a chance.
45838 Dwight Okay! Come on!

45841 Nellie Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
45842 Dwight Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
45843 Dwight Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
45844 Todd Packer Yep
45845 Dwight Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing â€“ bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love â€˜em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
45846 Ryan When people see this presentation, they're gonna [bleep] in their pants.
45847 Dwight Okay.
45848 Jim Come on, man.
45849 Cathy Seriously disgusting.
45850 Dwight Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
45851 Cathy Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.
45852 Dwight Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.

45855 Todd Packer I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player.
45856 Dwight Perfect casting, right?
45857 Todd Packer Schrute's out to get me. But I'm playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
45858 Nellie I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
45859 Dwight Speaking of pimples, let's release the BLOGGERS!

45885 Andy I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done.
45886 Dwight Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There's plenty for everyone!
45887 Man Quit it.
45888 Dwight There's plenty. Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
45889 Erin I was ahead of you!
45890 Dwight Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of Pyramids.

45920 Nellie Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
45921 Dwight Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing.
45922 Dwight Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?

45925 Jim I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
45926 Dwight You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
45927 Dwight Point it towards the store, idiot!
45928 Dwight [laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
45929 Dwight Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!

45948 Andy [softly] Take that, kid.
45949 Dwight Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
45950 Lady Blogger Patty Grossman. I'm a woman.
45951 Dwight But you still work for Wired, right?
45952 Patty Yes.
45953 Dwight Good! Okay. Flirt away.

45956 Ryan Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
45957 Dwight Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
45958 Ryan You know what?
45959 Dwight You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
45960 Jim Dwight.
45961 Dwight I'm trying to make him feel important.
45962 Ryan God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
45963 Dwight Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
45964 Ryan You're so ignorant. You barely know what you're talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
45965 Dwight What's a book? [giggles]

45972 Ryan Oh! "Fix" means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
45973 Dwight Jim, get him a water.
45974 Ryan No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
45975 Dwight Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!

46000 Andy Oh... [Kelly laughing]
46001 Dwight Have you seen Erin?
46002 Stanley I'm on break.
46003 Dwight Oh God...  Hey no! Where do you think you're going? You've gotta stay for the big presentation we've got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
46004 Blogger When's the presentation?
46005 Dwight It's moments away. Just stay here!

46017 Old Lady Well...
46018 Dwight How long has he been in the bathroom?
46019 Jim About ten minutes.
46020 Dwight Jeez! What's he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
46021 Jim Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
46022 Dwight Are there any bloggers around?
46023 Jim It's Ryan. "I'm sorry. I lied. I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home."
46024 Nellie What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here?
46025 Dwight I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
46026 Jim Uh...
46027 Nellie What?
46028 Dwight That's right. Will you just give us a second?

46031 Nellie That's....
46032 Dwight Jim --
46033 Jim I'm not doing the Presentation.
46034 Dwight Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you... if you don't do this, [whispers] I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim.
46035 Jim Okay, I'll do it.
46036 Dwight Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes.
46037 Jim A costume?
46038 Dwight Of course there's a costume! [laughs]  Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
46039 Dwight Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
46040 Jim I've been in here for 20 seconds.
46041 Dwight Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
46042 Jim I'm not wearing eyeliner.
46043 Dwight You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
46044 Jim Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that's --
46045 Dwight It's true.
46046 Jim This... is the future, because... This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
46047 Dwight Yep.
46048 Jim When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me.  I just wanted... to go home.  This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013.  You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
46049 Crowd ahhhhhh
46050 Dwight Psst.

46103 Pam Aw, I missed you.
46104 Dwight [feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
46105 Jim I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
46106 Dwight [on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]

46113 Nellie Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
46114 Dwight Ah!
46115 Nellie I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
46116 Dwight [to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
46117 Jim Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
46118 Dwight [sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
46119 Nellie He doesn't even care.
46120 Dwight Don't even care!

46167 Jim [to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
46168 Dwight Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
46169 Jim [attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight.
46170 Dwight [drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]

46180 Robert California I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight.
46181 Dwight [from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
46182 Robert California [to Dwight] Bravo, Dwight! Very good! [Jim looks surprised] [to Jim] Shame.
46183 Dwight [at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
46184 Nellie How did that look?
46185 Gabe I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
46186 Dwight [to Nellie] I told you.
46187 Todd Packer When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-
46188 Dwight You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
46189 Jim [enters room] All right. There he is.
46190 Dwight What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
46191 Jim Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
46192 Dwight What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
46193 Jim Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
46194 Dwight You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
46195 Todd Packer Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?
46196 Dwight [to Packer] Silence.
46197 Todd Packer Aw, I'm just trying to-
46198 Dwight [interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
46199 Todd Packer That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
46200 Dwight Different guy.
46201 Jim You know, I just think you should know that-
46202 Dwight [interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]

46255 Kevin Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
46256 Dwight [straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.
46257 Jim [enters abruptly] Dwight.
46258 Dwight You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
46259 Jim OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
46260 Dwight Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
46261 Jim Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
46262 Dwight [rolls eyes] Jim, come on.
46263 Jim Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
46264 Dwight Uh-huh.
46265 Jim And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
46266 Dwight Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
46267 Jim Yes.
46268 Dwight [smiles] That's two things.
46269 Jim Dwight, please.
46270 Dwight Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
46271 Jim OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
46272 Dwight You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
46273 Jim Dwight, come o-
46274 Dwight Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
46275 Dwight [Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
46276 Jim Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
46277 Dwight AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
46278 Jim Gross!
46279 Dwight [attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah!
46280 Jim What? What, what, what, what, what?
46281 Dwight [clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
46282 Jim I'm sorry.
46283 Dwight My wound hasn't healed yet.
46284 Jim I'm so sorry, I forgot.
46285 Dwight Oh, man!
46286 Jim You all right? You ok?
46287 Dwight [stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!

46301 Pam We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
46302 Dwight [trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]
46303 Jim What are you doing?
46304 Dwight I was trying to go-
46305 Jim Get up.
46306 Dwight Ok, ok.
46307 Jim Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
46308 Dwight Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
46309 Jim OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
46310 Dwight [tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]

46326 Jim [tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
46327 Dwight This. Ends. Now.
46328 Jim This is dangerous.
46329 Dwight [picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall]
46330 Jim Why?
46331 Dwight Anything else you need to talk about?
46332 Jim Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
46333 Dwight [looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.

46353 Andy You don't have a toothbrush?
46354 Dwight My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.

46361 Andy You just use whichever one is sitting there?
46362 Dwight Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]

46370 Phyllis Yeah.
46371 Dwight Right here.

46376 Nellie Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
46377 Dwight What?
46378 Dwight How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.

46481 Jim Dwight, should she be our manager?
46482 Dwight I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
46483 Dwight Those who can't farm, farm celery.

46487 Nellie Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
46488 Dwight I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
46489 Nellie Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
46490 Dwight What?
46491 Nellie Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
46492 Dwight There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
46493 Nellie Then you accept it?
46494 Dwight Five percent. No less.
46495 Nellie Absolutely not. Seven percent.
46496 Dwight Six percent, I know my worth.
46497 Jim The raise isn't real.
46498 Dwight Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.

46526 Jim I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
46527 Dwight No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
46528 Darryl No.
46529 Dwight Yes.
46530 Darryl No.
46531 Dwight Yes.
46532 Darryl No.
46533 Dwight Yes.
46534 Darryl No.
46535 Dwight Yes.
46536 Darryl No.
46537 Dwight Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
46538 Dwight [Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
46539 Dwight [panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.

46620 Magician Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?
46621 Dwight Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.

46626 Jim I'll do it.
46627 Dwight Yep.

46634 Magician Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? [Jim drops the cards] You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya?
46635 Dwight Yes!

46647 Robert People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-
46648 Dwight Okay scram, wizard.

46651 Robert [laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty?
46652 Dwight You heard me!

46686 Andy Bye guys.
46687 Dwight Okay, okay.

46700 Various You don't even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!
46701 Dwight Why Jim?

46749 Erin What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
46750 Dwight [lifting box] Ugh! Ow.
46751 Jim Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
46752 Dwight Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is."
46753 Jim That was one time-
46754 Dwight I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.

46758 Jim Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
46759 Dwight [shouting] Haulin' cube!

46782 Jessica Andy! Hey!
46783 Dwight I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
46784 Jim Yes, you should.
46785 Dwight [finds shoe box] Ooh.
46786 Jim [reads] "Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie."
46787 Dwight I have to see these shoes.
46788 Jim I doubt that they're sh-
46789 Dwight Oh!
46790 Jim Whoa. Who is this guy?
46791 Dwight Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
46792 Jim Boyfriend.
46793 Dwight Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
46794 Jim Like a boyfriend?
46795 Dwight You read my mind.
46796 Jim Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
46797 Dwight Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.

46801 Nellie I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
46802 Dwight Why not call...
46803 Jim Shh!
46804 Nellie God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
46805 Dwight That's awful. What kind of restaurant.

46808 Jim I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
46809 Dwight If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.

46963 Andy No.
46964 Dwight Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
46965 Robert Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?
46966 Dwight I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.

47064 Erin When you lost the manager job-
47065 Dwight Yes?
47066 Erin Did it affect you outside of the office?
47067 Dwight How?
47068 Erin I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
47069 Dwight Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
47070 Erin Oh, okay.
47071 Dwight Okay?
47072 Erin Okay.
47073 Dwight Washington Monument.
47074 Erin Oh.
47075 Dwight Eiffel Tower.

47081 Pam I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
47082 Dwight One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
47083 Dwight Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
47084 Dwight Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
47085 Nellie What do you mean?
47086 Dwight Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.

47097 Nellie This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
47098 Dwight It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.

47107 Kevin Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
47108 Dwight No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]

47131 Robert Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.
47132 Dwight Yeah Jim.

47143 Gabe I know, right?
47144 Dwight You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.

47210 Ryan Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
47211 Dwight You don't like the Beatles?
47212 Ryan That's... That's not the point!
47213 Dwight Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?

47231 Angela My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
47232 Dwight I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
47233 Jim Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
47234 Oscar What's going on?
47235 Dwight There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
47236 Erin Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
47237 Dwight That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male "hanging out". Call the cops!
47238 Pam Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
47239 Phyllis How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
47240 Dwight I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.

47272 Kevin No! It was my idea to not be raped!
47273 Dwight [Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
47274 Kevin Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
47275 Dwight You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!

47320 Jim Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
47321 Dwight [on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
47322 Dwight It's $475! Like candy from a baby!

47380 Speaker The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute!
47381 Dwight [applause] Yes! Thank you!
47382 Speaker The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute!
47383 Dwight [applause] Oh yes! Yeah!
47384 Speaker A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!
47385 Dwight [applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
47386 Speaker Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here!
47387 Dwight Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
47388 Speaker Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause]
47389 Jim Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
47390 Dwight Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something

47434 Nellie Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
47435 Dwight Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don't you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.

47438 Nellie Oh!
47439 Dwight Oh, I bet you think it's all about core, huh?

47442 Nellie Oh, gosh.
47443 Dwight Oh, please.

47450 Nellie Oh, god, Pam. Don't get me started.
47451 Dwight Feast on this, Lewis.

47460 Pam But sometimes he talks about flesh... and bacchanals.
47461 Dwight Oh, thank you.

47472 Robert [Erin opens door] Erin.
47473 Dwight Very funny Jim.

47480 Robert Yeah, hello?
47481 Dwight I don't need your help.

47484 Robert You're blackmailing me.
47485 Dwight Here, here... Just...

47509 Jim All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
47510 Dwight What?
47511 Dwight Good, we have a deal?
47512 Jim Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
47513 Jim Thanks Janet.
47514 Dwight How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don't even care about nationals.
47515 Dwight Thanks so much Earl.

47518 Jim I don't know. I've always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
47519 Dwight And they said it couldn't be done. Boom!

47527 Jim Hey, hey, come on, language.
47528 Dwight Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
47529 Jim In the fridge.
47530 Dwight No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.

47554 Erin Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
47555 Dwight And you are...

47560 Jim The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
47561 Dwight Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to â€“ how do I put this â€“ steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
47562 Jim Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
47563 Dwight Yes.
47564 Jim Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
47565 Dwight [pointing at Toby] There he is. That's Lloyd.

47572 Jim There's actually not a rule that says that.
47573 Dwight That's true.
47574 Toby That's true. There's no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
47575 Toby No.
47576 Dwight Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could've choked so many people by now.

47582 Harry Robert's here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don't think we were doing that.
47583 Dwight Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim's leg.

47595 Robert Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems... so poorly timed.
47596 Dwight Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
47597 Harry Listen, Robert, I don't have time. There's a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions â€“
47598 Dwight Don't listen to him.
47599 Harry Used to be Binghamton's â€“
47600 Dwight Nope.
47601 Harry I want it, it's mine.
47602 Dwight Prestige is ours. Okay, they're responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
47603 Harry We need you to make a decision.
47604 Dwight Make a decision.

47608 Harry Is it just me or is our boss a freakin' weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I'm gonna get some air.
47609 Dwight Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
47610 Jim [Gets up and looks out Nellie's office window] He's running!
47611 Dwight Damn it!
47612 Jim Damn it.
47613 Dwight Wha â€“ what is this supposed to be?
47614 Jim It's a monkey.
47615 Dwight Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
47616 Jim Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
47617 Dwight What?
47618 Jim Is that him?
47619 Dwight It's him! Do something! Get out!
47620 Jim What? What am I gonna do? I don't â€“
47621 Dwight Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five second delay.
47622 Jim Dwight!
47623 Dwight Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
47624 Jim Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
47625 Dwight Yeah.
47626 Jim Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
47627 Dwight Hit the nos.
47628 Jim Are you sure?
47629 Dwight Yes.
47630 Jim Brace yourself. 3... 2...
47631 Dwight Got it. Go.

47660 Andy Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe... you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
47661 Dwight Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
47662 Dwight [Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]
47663 Jim You all right?
47664 Dwight Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
47665 Jim Ah! [Harry walks in]
47666 Jim [Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
47667 Dwight Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
47668 Jim What are you talking about?
47669 Dwight Just run! Take the stairs!
47670 Jim I don't even know where the stairs are!
47671 Dwight I'll stall him. Go!
47672 Jim God!
47673 Harry [Dwight jumping] What are you doing?
47674 Dwight I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
47675 Jim What?
47676 Dwight My pants fell down! I don't have a belt!
47677 Dwight [walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
47678 Mr. Ramish What's going on?
47679 Dwight Well â€“
47680 Harry Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse â€“
47681 Dwight I was here first.
47682 Mr. Ramish Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
47683 Dwight I already made an appointment... with your secretary.
47684 Mr. Ramish Let me stop you all right here. I've already picked a new paper supplier.
47685 Dwight Wait, it's not D.M Utica, is it?

47690 Harry Give me a cup of coffee.
47691 Dwight Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
47692 Jim All right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us, so... we're still on the same team. Let me get these.
47693 Dwight No. Let him get his own. It's Syracuse money.
47694 Harry You know, your partner's got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?
47695 Dwight Jim couldn't land me in a thousand years.
47696 Jim But you're saying there's a chance.
47697 Dwight Shut up.

47724 David Pleasure.
47725 Dwight He's searching out younger gays.

47730 Robert Please. [laughs]
47731 Dwight ...with you. [chuckles]

47756 Nellie May I say one thing?
47757 Dwight You okay, Robert?

47760 Nellie The quality of mercy is not strained.
47761 Dwight Put some ice on it.

47766 Andy Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
47767 Dwight I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, "muffin basket." Then I thought, "What's even more precious to people than muffins?"

47772 Andy If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
47773 Dwight ...their own children.
47774 Nellie Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
47775 Dwight Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?

47778 David Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
47779 Dwight Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.

47784 Robert David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.
47785 Dwight [Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!

47797 Darryl And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
47798 Dwight Hello.

47801 Darryl Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
47802 Dwight They're testing it now.

47805 Darryl The coconut's pretty subtle.
47806 Dwight Seventy-two hours.

47809 Darryl I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
47810 Dwight Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand]

47863 Kevin Wait, C-R-A-Z...
47864 Dwight Great, right up there.

47882 Jim Great.
47883 Dwight Up here. [whistles]
47884 Jim Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
47885 Dwight Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
47886 Jim Oh, so that's it?
47887 Dwight That's it.
47888 Pam See? That wasn't so hard.
47889 Dwight Cute kids, thanks for coming.

47896 Senator Lipton Thanks.
47897 Dwight Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
47898 Angela Dwight.
47899 Dwight Nice to see you. May I hold him?

47903 Angela [Phillip cries] See the duckie!
47904 Dwight Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
47905 Senator Lipton Oh, thank you.
47906 Angela [slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
47907 Dwight Really?

47917 Erin Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
47918 Dwight Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
47919 Angela Uh-uh, leave us alone.
47920 Senator Lipton I guess we're okay with the fingernails.
47921 Dwight Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?

47925 Senator Lipton I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.
47926 Dwight He defecated, aw.

47946 Angela No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
47947 Dwight Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?

47981 Toby Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
47982 Dwight [into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.

48016 Erin Andy's coming back today! Andy's coming back today! Ha! Andy's coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.
48017 Dwight How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.

48075 Andy No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.
48076 Dwight I don't see it.
48077 Clark I don't either.
48078 Andy Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?
48079 Dwight Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]
48080 Andy Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]
48081 Dwight In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson.

48102 Andy Now I know why Michael hated you so much.
48103 Dwight Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
48104 Clark Yep, body by Cheez-it
48105 Dwight Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
48106 Clark I think I'm busy that night. Or I would.
48107 Dwight Well, we're both just kinda learning as we go, aren't we?
48108 Clark Learning what?
48109 Dwight Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
48110 Clark Kay.
48111 Dwight So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
48112 Clark Is thisâ€”is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that's totally fine. Like, I'm fine with it. But you should know that I'm into the ladies.
48113 Dwight Spoken like a true root man.
48114 Clark You know, if you're ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.
48115 Dwight My calls?
48116 Clark So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven't had time to pursue yet?
48117 Dwight You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
48118 Clark Yeah, I'll just give it a glanceâ€”
48119 Dwight Ok
48120 Clark I'll give it a read.
48121 Dwight With my leads and stuff like that?
48122 Clark Yeah.
48123 Dwight Cause you're interested in going into sales?
48124 Clark I am.
48125 Dwight Wow, that's great. That's great. Ok, good, let's talk about that, ok?
48126 Clark Ok.
48127 Dwight You're not getting my clients! Nice try.
48128 Dwight Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
48129 Dwight Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
48130 Jim Done. Explain.
48131 Dwight The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
48132 Jim Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.
48133 Dwight Wait, salesâ€”what sales meeting?
48134 Jim The new guys called one.
48135 Dwight The new guys called a sales meeting?
48136 Jim Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
48137 Dwight There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?

48175 Andy Hey, yes.
48176 Dwight Boo, unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo!

48179 Andy Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?
48180 Dwight Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
48181 Clark You got this, it's all you. [as Dwight repeatedly fails and gets smacked around] Got ourselves a yard sale. Balls in face. It's not a race, Dwight.
48182 Andy Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.
48183 Dwight [bleeding heavily from the mouth] That's not true. Just give me another chance.
48184 Oscar But your mouth is bleâ€”
48185 Toby This is a bloodbath. Alright, I'm calling this.
48186 Dwight What?
48187 Toby It is enough of this. Everyone, let's go back to work.
48188 Dwight This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.
48189 Dwight Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope!
48190 Pam Dwight!
48191 Dwight Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
48192 Pam [sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing?
48193 Dwight Come here, I'll show you.

48200 Jim Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.
48201 Dwight Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it's literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
48202 Pam I will?
48203 Dwight You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say?
48204 Pam Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.
48205 Dwight So you'll do it?
48206 Pam No.
48207 Dwight Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
48208 Pam Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.
48209 Dwight Come on.
48210 Pam Exactly the way it is.
48211 Dwight No, Pam.
48212 Pam Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.
48213 Dwight Please? Please, Pam?
48214 Pam Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis.
48215 Dwight I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive.

48229 Pam Kay.
48230 Dwight Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.
48231 Dwight Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
48232 Jim Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!
48233 Dwight Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!

48241 Pam [surveying an untidy office] The building's custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.
48242 Dwight No, no. No spoilers. Please.

48245 Pam Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning and... you see what chore you get that day.
48246 Dwight No.

48307 Pete That's really nice.
48308 Dwight [as he and Nellie watch the movie] Oh god.

48311 Pete [referring to the letter] It's open.
48312 Dwight Yeah.

48315 Pete [whispering] OK.
48316 Dwight Yes.

48319 Creed I know you don't really exist.
48320 Dwight If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.

48323 Roy [at Roy's wedding] Darryl! Ha-ha! What's happening?
48324 Dwight Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.

48327 Roy Ah, thank you!
48328 Dwight Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.

48331 Pam Think so.
48332 Dwight No, like you.

48335 Pam [taking glass] Thank you.
48336 Dwight You're the stupid one.

48339 Pam [embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]
48340 Dwight You're the stupid one.

48343 Pam [as Jim receives and declines a call] Who's that?
48344 Dwight You, you, you, you...

48356 Nellie Dwight, what about you?
48357 Dwight I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.

48361 Nellie Dwight, you will be participating.
48362 Dwight No thank you.
48363 Nellie Participation is mandatory
48364 Dwight Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
48365 Nellie Great, thank you.
48366 Dwight Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
48367 Nellie [everyone groans] Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight.
48368 Dwight Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
48369 Creed The Taliban is the worst. Great heroine, though.
48370 Nellie Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.
48371 Dwight Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]

48426 Nellie You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.
48427 Dwight Anything else would be inconsistent.
48428 Nellie Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office? [offers Dwight a contract]
48429 Dwight [takes contract] Absolutely, I will.
48430 Dwight I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. [in a fake English accent] You don't have a plan.
48431 Nellie When you use a ridiculous font, no one thinks you have a plan.
48432 Nellie [holds up pen as Dwight searches his desk] Looking for this?
48433 Dwight What the? [follows Nellie into the break room]
48434 Nellie Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.
48435 Dwight [taking pen back] Gimme that.
48436 Nellie Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.
48437 Dwight You're insane.
48438 Nellie I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.
48439 Dwight Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
48440 Nellie In that case, you... [pulls out a cleaver] will have to chop off my hand.
48441 Dwight [considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
48442 Nellie I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.
48443 Dwight Sounds like a plan.

48498 Pete [whispering] Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.
48499 Dwight [places Nellie's hand on a board and holds up cleaver] This is it. Any questions?
48500 Nellie Is it gonna be long?
48501 Dwight No. It's gonna be over before you know it.

48524 Jim God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
48525 Dwight Heh! Ha! [making various sounds and movements while preparing to severe Nellie's hand] [Darryl enters, sees what's happening, and quietly exits]

48532 Pete Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know. [Andy smiles at camera]
48533 Dwight Ha! [raises cleaver] This is for real this time.

48538 Nellie [quietly] This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.
48539 Dwight Who are you?

48542 Nellie [to Darryl] You know what this is all about.
48543 Dwight You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian

48546 Nellie Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!
48547 Dwight Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?

48554 Pam I still can't believe he didn't tell me.
48555 Dwight How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!

48558 Stanley Do not care.
48559 Dwight You don't work here! You're not Jim!

48566 Erin [in agreement] Hmmm!
48567 Dwight I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
48568 Dwight Oh myâ€”! Oh dâ€”! Oh, how didâ€”? [gasps] Huhhhhh!

48574 Erin [speaking in French] S"il vous plait...dites-Moi...Ugggghhh les Bleagh!
48575 Dwight Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
48576 Erin I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!
48577 Dwight You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
48578 Dwight Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
48579 Dwight I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
48580 Erin Yeah! Let's do it!
48581 Dwight [exclaims] Atherozar!
48582 Erin [shocked] Oh!
48583 Dwight It means "excellent". And we have begun.

48630 Stanley Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.
48631 Dwight I throat-rip.
48632 Erin Foth aggendak!
48633 Dwight You throat-rip.
48634 Erin Foth aggendi!
48635 Dwight He/she/it throat rips.
48636 Erin Foth aggenda!
48637 Dwight More of a, barbaric growl.
48638 Erin [in a barbaric growl] Forth aggenda!
48639 Dwight Louder! You're shouting it from the back of a horse!

48667 Erin Addor!
48668 Dwight Daraas!
48669 Erin Qazer!
48670 Dwight Daraas! [asks the rest of the office] Does anyone here have fermented mare's milk?

48687 Erin Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.
48688 Dwight People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.

48717 Andy Dwight's grandfather was aâ€”[is interrupted by Dwight].
48718 Dwight Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So...[clears throat]
48719 Andy I was gonna say he was a tax evader.
48720 Dwight Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!

48725 Kevin Yeah, thatâ€”you're being really mean, Andy.
48726 Dwight Yeah, Andy.

48784 Andy Andy Bernard presents
48785 Dwight I'm barren, Jim.

48788 Andy Fail.
48789 Dwight My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.

48792 Andy A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! [Points to video] Who's this guy? [Jim steps back and forth from plate on video as Andy sings Meow Mix theme]Look at him dance. Fail!
48793 Dwight You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
48794 Dwight Fail!
48795 Jim No.
48796 Jim I deserved that.
48797 Dwight That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done. [laughs]

48819 Jim I think I got it right here. [Cheering on screen, Andy struggles with lifting water cooler, then falls over dumping the fluids on himself][Group laughs]
48820 Dwight Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?

48823 Group Fail! Fail! Fail!...
48824 Dwight What position did you use to conceive?
48825 Andy [Group continues chanting "Fail!"]That was actually a serious accident that could have resulted in severe bodily harm. [Group keeps chanting] You're all failing right now. [Group continues] Congratulations on your epic fail of the use of the word fail! [Group claps and chants]
48826 Jim Ok...that's not...
48827 Dwight [Toby uses tester on wall as Erin marks wall with red tape X] Oh, god.
48828 Dwight Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
48829 Phyllis What's going on?
48830 Andy [To Pete. Crying sounds come from behind Nelly's curtain] British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?
48831 Dwight Nothing! Nothing is going on. Keep moving please.

48834 Andy What?
48835 Dwight OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.

48839 Phyllis [Gasps] Oh my god!
48840 Dwight You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.

48843 Andy Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?
48844 Dwight Bildenkinder.

48850 Jim It's pretty good actually.
48851 Dwight OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
48852 Pam Yeah?
48853 Dwight [mocking] Oh, the wires need insulation. [normal voice] It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.

48857 Jim You got it.
48858 Dwight When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!

48861 Nellie Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.
48862 Dwight Oh, better than OK. [grabs Pam's shoulders] You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.

48871 Andy A baby what? A human?!
48872 Dwight Everybody! Hang on! [Dwight pulls out quickly]

48908 Pam You did it.
48909 Dwight [Reading from computer] "Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!" That means you can't make me do squat.

48912 Group [bored] Yeah.
48913 Dwight You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls. We'd have to shut this place down for a week.

48939 Jim Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause. [group agrees, protests]
48940 Dwight What? Come on.
48941 Creed I'm getting older. I'm losing my hair...
48942 Meredith I'm not gonna grow a third arm!
48943 Dwight I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
48944 Jim [reading from computer] "Side effects of EMF include
48945 Dwight Had 'em all my life.
48946 Jim "..breast pain..."
48947 Dwight No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
48948 Jim Oof. "Infertility."
48949 Dwight [scoffs] Yeah right. [Dwight moves mouse pad over his crotch]
48950 Jim Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
48951 Dwight Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. [notices popped kernels in the bag] What the?
48952 Jim What?
48953 Dwight Some of these kernels have crowned.
48954 Jim That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag...[looks up to ceiling where there is a red tape X over Dwight's chair] Oh my god.
48955 Dwight Andy! [Jim mimes basketball shot]

48962 Andy Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.
48963 Dwight So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
48964 Meredith Nice job.
48965 Dwight In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.

48969 Jim What?
48970 Dwight [Bus pulls into lot] Bring it in!
48971 Dwight Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. [Meredith and Kevin bump chairs in bus angrily] If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. [Erin tapes candy dish to pole] In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.

49006 Jim Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. [Dwight smiles at Jim] Really? Smirking?
49007 Dwight What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
49008 Jim Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
49009 Dwight It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.

49015 Stanley No question.
49016 Dwight No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.

49023 Jim [To Dwight] So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
49024 Dwight Get your foot behind the yellow line.

49071 Kevin Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work.
49072 Dwight I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
49073 Jim OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
49074 Dwight That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.

49078 Group No!
49079 Dwight Stop ordering me around, Jim!

49083 Group Pies!
49084 Dwight OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. [drops keys in Jim's lap] Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.

49099 Andy Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point! [group gasps]
49100 Dwight This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.

49103 Andy You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man's signature solo is his for life, okay? That's group policy and you know it.
49104 Dwight [screaming then laughing] It may have been the costliest decision I've ever made.
49105 Broccoli Rob Look, it's not my fault that I still live near campus, and it's my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week.
49106 Dwight My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...

49109 Broccoli Rob I tell you what, we'll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and I'll do the same, and I'm so confident that I'll win, I won't even warm up.
49110 Dwight I can't get it out. Try again!
49111 Andy Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.
49112 Dwight I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
49113 Broccoli Rob My pipes are primo, Champ. Why don't you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes?
49114 Dwight [as Jim approaches with a knife] Jim, no. No. No! No!
49115 Andy I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!
49116 Dwight But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
49117 Broccoli Rob He said, and I quote, â€˜Hey Rob, nice pipes'. That happened!
49118 Dwight At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?

49169 Erin Well, um, you know maybe you're the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--
49170 Dwight What lab did these little clones escape from?

49178 Andy Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.
49179 Dwight [whispering] I want some of those pills.

49182 Clark I do. I love the boss's interests.
49183 Dwight Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They're not for me. They're for my cousin Mose. He's just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.

49186 Meredith Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?
49187 Dwight Which one? Mose or the real Mose?

49190 Andy You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael's Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I'm so not prepared.
49191 Dwight He says Thank you.

49200 Pam Okay.
49201 Dwight Jim. Look I'm eating you.
49202 Jim Shut up.
49203 Dwight Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I'm eating Jims.
49204 Erin [laughs]
49205 Dwight [laughing] Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
49206 Erin [laughing hysterically] Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
49207 Dwight Oh no, I'm spilling Jim all over the carpet. [laughing]
49208 Erin Stop it stop it stop it stop it!
49209 Dwight [picking up spilled candy] Hello little pill. What do you do?
49210 Dwight Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation

49213 Pam [laughing] Gross. I love it.
49214 Dwight Dumatril!
49215 Nellie Something wrong Dwight?
49216 Dwight Dumatril.
49217 Nellie Yes?
49218 Dwight This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it's not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It's not for any disorder of the body. [whispering] It's for a disorder of the mind.
49219 Nellie The mind is part of the body.
49220 Dwight Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... [whispering] They are now off their meds.
49221 Nellie Dwight, our co-workers' health issues are really none of our business so-
49222 Dwight Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What's going on Nellie? Talk to me.

49225 Nellie Yeah, you're right. This man needs to be apprehended.
49226 Dwight I'll get my apprehension kit.

49260 Jim All right. [laughs] Awesome. Cool.
49261 Dwight Hi Daryl. I'm just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
49262 Nellie You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.
49263 Dwight That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
49264 Darryl I can't really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.
49265 Dwight So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
49266 Darryl Get under your chin first. Yeah.
49267 Dwight Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
49268 Darryl Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.
49269 Dwight Is that how they like to get in?
49270 Darryl Yeah, that's crazy.
49271 Dwight [whispering] I don't know. I just don't know.

49299 Toby Hey.
49300 Dwight Hey.

49309 Nellie [laughing] It's funny right? [Toby starts to lean in for a kiss, then runs away]
49310 Dwight All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
49311 Nellie Okay, look Dwight, let's just call this thing off. I mean, it's just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.
49312 Dwight You think I don't have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I've got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne'er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don't need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
49313 Meredith Cool. Free upper.
49314 Dwight Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
49315 Meredith Don't dog catch me!
49316 Dwight Gotcha! Yeah! Let's see ya get out of this web, huh?
49317 Meredith Let me out!
49318 Nellie The pill is mine.
49319 Dwight What?
49320 Nellie Get her out.
49321 Dwight Oh.

49370 Stanley Show some pride. This is crap.
49371 Dwight I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.

49429 Andy [pulling away from dock] Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!
49430 Dwight I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
49431 Erin Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.
49432 Dwight The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? [Pretends to be on phone] "Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt." It's that easy.

49445 Pete Hey. She's back.
49446 Dwight [wagging tongue for voice exercises] blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...[Group protests]

49449 Pete Yeah, no problem. How was it?
49450 Dwight ...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.

49453 Pete Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.
49454 Dwight [walking away] Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....

49491 Pete Awesome. Have fun.
49492 Dwight Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- [phone rings in break room, Dwight picks up] This is Dwight Shrute.
49493 Pam [on other end in conference room] Please hold for Ms. Black.
49494 Nellie [Darryl plays radio show music on keyboard] And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.
49495 Dwight Iris, thank you so much for having me.

49526 Erin Let's do it!
49527 Dwight [On speakerphone] Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
49528 Nellie [As Iris] So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?
49529 Dwight Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
49530 Nellie Uh, excuse me. [reading card held up by Jim] I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?
49531 Dwight Yes..?
49532 Nellie [Jim mimes taking shirt off] I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.
49533 Dwight [Takes shirt off] Now then, we were saying. When my workers-gather-
49534 Nellie Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. [Jim holds up card that says "Now Pants"] Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.
49535 Dwight That's impossible.

49546 Kevin Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble.
49547 Dwight [pantless] OK, how is my voice now?
49548 Nellie I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?
49549 Dwight [holding hand over phone] This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.

49554 Oscar Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.
49555 Dwight This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! [Pam tells Jim to leave the conference room] I dare you to produce one credible source about this.

49559 Pam No the paper's not toxic.
49560 Dwight Thank you Sandra!
49561 Pam Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!
49562 Dwight Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled! [Jim runs panicked into break room]
49563 Jim What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
49564 Dwight Get out of here moron! [Jim leaves]
49565 Nellie Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?
49566 Dwight uhhhh....no one.
49567 Nellie Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?
49568 Dwight No, everything's fine.
49569 Nellie Are you insulting my guests?
49570 Dwight [chokes up]

49579 Kevin Oh that is nice. Classy move. [leaves]
49580 Dwight [yelling in break room] That's what I'm saying! No of course not!

49594 Nellie The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?
49595 Dwight My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!

49645 Jim [using black voice] Good afternoon! [Darryl smacks his arm]
49646 Dwight Please sir! Spare him. Please.
49647 Jim Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
49648 Dwight Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.

49658 David Wallace [On phone] Hello?
49659 Dwight David, is that you?
49660 David Wallace Dwight?
49661 Dwight Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
49662 David Wallace Yeah? Are you ok?
49663 Dwight Oh, I'm OK. I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
49664 David Wallace Well, thanks Dwight.
49665 Dwight You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
49666 David Wallace Dwight?
49667 Dwight Walk out of the house...
49668 David Wallace What?
49669 Dwight ...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
49670 David Wallace Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.
49671 Dwight [enters main office, group claps] Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
49672 All Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!
49673 Dwight [joins in] Shrute! Shrute!
49674 Dwight Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.

49703 Darryl He's been sailing for two days.
49704 Dwight Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I've got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.

49709 Andy No. No! Nooo! [computer falls into ocean]
49710 Dwight You're the Quizno's. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn't quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
49711 Erin Andy? Andy! Andy! Andy. Oh.
49712 Jan I -- I --
49713 Dwight [answering phone] Dwight Schrute. [turns on speakerphone] Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
49714 Dwight Hmm?
49715 David [on speakerphone] Well, I have some very exciting news.
49716 Jan I don't recall. And yes, Molly is crap.
49717 Dwight And you didn't call Jim - that seems significant.

49721 David Jim, good! You should hear this too.
49722 Dwight He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
49723 Dwight No, he shouldn't.
49724 Jan Will you uh, [clicks tongue] you. Can you turn around for me, please? Dwight you can go. I will call you in a week or so and let you know whether I want your business.
49725 Jim [taking away Dwight's handset] Go ahead David, I'm listening.
49726 Dwight Very good.
49727 Dwight Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don't know where I'd put you.

49730 Jim Jim Halpert.
49731 Dwight The White Pages.
49732 Colin [on phone] Hey, it's Colin.
49733 Dwight The White Pages

49736 Colin I know. Don't worry about it.
49737 Dwight I'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where's Stanley?

49740 Colin It's just... it's not totally working.
49741 Dwight Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?

49744 Colin Yeah, well, it's not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don't know how we're gonna do this.
49745 Dwight Yeah! Okay. [presses button again] Hey David, I'm back.

49748 Angela Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?
49749 Dwight So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?

49752 Angela Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?
49753 Dwight Her name?

49756 Angela [ducking under table with Oscar] Oh. Oh.
49757 Dwight Shhh! [clears throat] Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!

49760 Pam Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.
49761 Dwight Good luck to you. [disconnects call]
49762 Molly Thanks. Okay.
49763 Phyllis Dwight, you can't go. You have a problem with women. You can't sell to them.
49764 Dwight Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can't be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
49765 Dwight That is a damnable lie. I love women.
49766 Pam Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.
49767 Phyllis Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her â€˜gy-na' for your entire meeting.
49768 Dwight Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.

49771 Phyllis Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.
49772 Dwight That's all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
49773 Dwight â€˜Gy-na' said that?
49774 Pam Oh. Why me?
49775 Phyllis Guys, we can't let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.
49776 Dwight Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It's like air to you people. Ugh, God. [retching]

49813 Phyllis So, uh, show us how you'd normally sell to a female client.
49814 Dwight Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
49815 Pam You've got this Schrute.
49816 Phyllis Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.
49817 Dwight Hello.
49818 Erin Hello.
49819 Dwight May I please speak to your boss?
49820 Phyllis No, she is the boss.
49821 Erin I am? Hmm.. [deep voice] Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon. How can I help you?
49822 Dwight Okay, this isn't working for me, â€˜cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
49823 Erin He's absolutely right. I'm really struggling.
49824 Pam Oh, I'll be the buyer.
49825 Dwight [sighing]
49826 Pam Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.
49827 Dwight I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
49828 Phyllis No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.
49829 Dwight I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I'm finished, it's over.
49830 Pam Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?
49831 Dwight I thought it went great.

49850 Pam Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?
49851 Dwight Yes.
49852 Pam Okay, well you have to show us.
49853 Dwight That's impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don't vibrate at all.
49854 Pam Huh. [nodding] Uh huh.
49855 Dwight What are you doing?
49856 Pam A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?
49857 Dwight Kind of.

49860 Erin It's just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.
49861 Dwight I am a person.
49862 Erin Yes.
49863 Nellie And then we thought we'd ... I can't. I just can't carry on with that face. Look at it. I'm gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he's laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.
49864 Dwight That's a bit extreme.

49867 Phyllis Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It's all garbage okay? You're the woman, I'm the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.
49868 Dwight Okay, I'm a woman. [high voice] I'm a woman. Good?
49869 Phyllis Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.
49870 Dwight Hello.
49871 Phyllis Oh, are those your kids? They're so cute! They could be models.
49872 Dwight Thank you. I'm so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my v*g1n*.

49877 Pam You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.
49878 Dwight Look, I have no problem with women. It's businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don't lie about your shoulders!
49879 Pam Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?
49880 Dwight I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
49881 Pam Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber.
49882 Dwight Okay, I can do that.
49883 Pam Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.
49884 Dwight He used to fight dogs.
49885 Pam Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?
49886 Dwight Little of this, little of that.

49914 Pam Okay, great.
49915 Dwight [to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
49916 Pam Oh my God. It's Jan.
49917 Dwight Oh, dear God in heaven.

49924 Jan I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?
49925 Dwight Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs]

49931 Jan I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing?
49932 Dwight Listening.
49933 Jan Stop.
49934 Dwight Sorry.
49935 Jan Stop that.
49936 Dwight Okay.

49941 Pam You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us.
49942 Dwight Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I'll be right back.

49986 Oscar No, thank you, Angela.
49987 Dwight No.
49988 Oscar She doesn't know. I shouldn't be surprised. This is a woman who married a man who is obviously a homosexual. Basically, she has her head in the sand. In a way I feel sorry for her. I guess the universe rewards true love.
49989 Trevor If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend.
49990 Dwight Well, well, well, it's finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
49991 Oscar What the hell, Dwight?
49992 Pam These are my painting clothes.I think I'm gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today. [Jim applauds]
49993 Dwight See ya later, Trevor.

49996 Jim You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
49997 Dwight I just saved your life. You're welcome!

50020 Angela [upon seeing Dwight naked] Ugh!
50021 Dwight Oscar.
50022 Dwight Come on in, the water's fine.

50025 Everyone [cheers and applause]
50026 Dwight I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks]

50029 Nellie Yes!
50030 Dwight Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband?

50033 Pete Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.
50034 Dwight [sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?

50037 Meredith Wow.
50038 Dwight Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.

50041 Everyone [cheers and applause as Pete puts last card on tower]
50042 Dwight I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text.

50045 Erin Yeah!
50046 Dwight Text went through.
50047 Angela I feel so stupid. I sit next to him every day.
50048 Angela Okay.
50049 Dwight You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
50050 Dwight All we can do is sit and wait.
50051 Angela [crying] Jazz is stupid!  I mean, just play the right notes!
50052 Angela Okay.
50053 Dwight I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey.
50054 Dwight [phone vibrates] Oh, look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem.
50055 Angela I don't like your friend Trevor.
50056 Jim I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.
50057 Dwight I don't like him either.  And yet I really like him.

50088 Kevin Make it go taller.
50089 Dwight Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?

50106 Kevin Obviously. He's a sweet kid, Darryl. But he's not the sharpest guy in the drawer.
50107 Dwight Is it called red-vining?

50110 Kevin Huh?
50111 Dwight We heard it was called red-vining.
50112 Angela Ow! Dwight! Ow!
50113 Angela People red vine.
50114 Dwight Get in the van.
50115 Dwight Where are gay mens' vaginas?

50118 Trevor Is it safe to talk?
50119 Dwight What?
50120 Dwight Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good.
50121 Toby No. They're just regular men.
50122 Angela So what are your credentials?
50123 Dwight When two gay men have s*x, how do they know whose pen1s will open up to accept the other person's pen1s?

50126 Angela Do you have a gun?
50127 Dwight [snickers] Does he own a gun? Show her.

50132 Trevor Read the receipt. That's a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.
50133 Dwight Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor's had stolen from him?
50134 Trevor Now I keep it in a safe.
50135 Dwight Mm-hmm. Good safe?
50136 Trevor Oh, you tell me. [shows Dwight receipt]
50137 Dwight Wow!

50155 Pete All right.
50156 Dwight You get half now and half upon completion of said job.

50163 Trevor Okay, that's the big one. That's the big "M."
50164 Dwight You can't have someone murdered.
50165 Angela What if they deserved it?
50166 Dwight What did they do to you, Angela?
50167 Angela They're sleeping with my husband.
50168 Dwight Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.
50169 Trevor This seems a little crazy.
50170 Dwight Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
50171 Trevor But I think I'm up for it.
50172 Dwight No! No!
50173 Angela Thank you.
50174 Dwight Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I've had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--

50177 Trevor What about a knee-capping?
50178 Dwight No! You're not helping, Trevor!
50179 Angela Yes, a knee-capping could work.
50180 Dwight No. Angela! What are you saying?
50181 Angela You said you would be there for me.
50182 Dwight I'm trying, but what you're asking is--
50183 Angela It's the only thing that will make this right.
50184 Dwight Okay. But it's cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn.

50233 Angela What? Why did you call me out here?
50234 Dwight The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
50235 Angela I don't know what you're talking about.
50236 Dwight Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
50237 Angela Fine! It's Oscar. So what?
50238 Dwight Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
50239 Angela Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.
50240 Dwight I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
50241 Angela Well, you might be right. But it's too late now.
50242 Dwight What do you mean?
50243 Angela He's here.
50244 Dwight No! No, no! [groans]
50245 Dwight Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
50246 Oscar What?
50247 Dwight Come -- come with me.
50248 Oscar What are you doing?
50249 Dwight There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They're extraordinary.

50269 Phyllis Got it.
50270 Dwight There's no time to explain. [descending stairs] Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
50271 Oscar Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?
50272 Dwight What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child?
50273 Oscar I don't know what you're talking about.
50274 Dwight Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about.  Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us.
50275 Dwight Aah! Actually, he's right in front of us.
50276 Trevor Let's get it on. I'm gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I'm gonna do this.
50277 Dwight No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He's a Dunder-Mifflin man. He's my tribe.
50278 Trevor I'm sorry, Dwight, but for once in my stupid, stupid life, I'm gonna follow through on something, all right? I have masculinity issues-- Stop! No!
50279 Oscar I got it.
50280 Dwight Disarm!
50281 Trevor You don't-- [all three grunting]
50282 Dwight Don't move. And disarm now! [Oscar gets weapon away from others]
50283 Trevor Okay, okay, okay, okay.
50284 Dwight No! No, Oscar. He's a friend. He's a friend.

50293 Pam I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.
50294 Dwight Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]

50297 Phyllis We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.
50298 Dwight Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
50299 Jim So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word "Philadelphia"?
50300 Angela Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!
50301 Dwight Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning "Love," and adelph, meaning "Adolf." "the city that loves Adolf." Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.

50311 Kevin So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?
50312 Dwight Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.

50315 Kevin Well, you are the one in charge of it.
50316 Dwight Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.

50319 Oscar Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.
50320 Dwight I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.

50323 Phyllis I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.
50324 Dwight Damn It!

50330 Pete Yeah. Definitely. [Erin starts to cry] Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. [Starts to put his arm around Erin] Hey, hey. Come on, huh?
50331 Dwight What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.

50341 Stanley No. I want Tropical Christmas.
50342 Dwight No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.

50348 Jim What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
50349 Dwight Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.

50354 Nellie Too weird.
50355 Dwight [Holds his finger to Jim's lips] Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash! [High fives Jim]
50356 Dwight [Holds up a picture] This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.

50360 Angela [Blows a weak whistle] Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.
50361 Dwight [Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!

50365 Pete I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.
50366 Dwight Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.

50395 Pete Oh, that's okay, bud.
50396 Dwight Very impish.

50444 Pam [Clears her throat] The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.
50445 Dwight Yes! Yeah! [High Fives Jim] Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! [High Fives Pam] Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
50446 Pam Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.
50447 Dwight Uh-huh.
50448 Pam And that is...
50449 Dwight Uh, Oh.
50450 Pam That there are no rules.
50451 Dwight You have never been cooler.

50454 Jim Thank you.
50455 Dwight [Plays a trumpet] And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
50456 Meredith Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?
50457 Dwight That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
50458 Pam What is it? [Jim lifts the hog maw with a fork] Don't touch it.
50459 Dwight [Comes running up at startles Pam] Somebody's found the hog maw.
50460 Pam Oh!
50461 Dwight What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
50462 Stanley Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.
50463 Dwight It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
50464 Jim Can't wait.
50465 Meredith Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?
50466 Dwight This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
50467 Oscar How would anyone even know--
50468 Dwight Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?

50471 Jim So happy right now.
50472 Dwight [Speaking German] Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. [Blows out the candle] Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.

50492 Phyllis It's the lining of the stomach of--
50493 Dwight [Cackling] Ohh...[In a German Accent] Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
50494 Jim Yes, he is finally nigh.
50495 Dwight I am nigh!
50496 Dwight Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
50497 Dwight Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! [Runs over to Stanley and points at his stomach with a stick] Ohh...Too much strudel.
50498 Jim So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
50499 Dwight No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
50500 Jim Wow! It's my favorite part of Christmas. The authority.
50501 Pam And the fear.
50502 Dwight Yes, exactly!
50503 Phyllis Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.
50504 Dwight No.

50507 Pam Wow.
50508 Dwight Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
50509 Oscar [Continues reading] "His partner, zwarte piet, or black Peter, a slave boy, often portrayed in colorful pantaloons and blackface."
50510 Stanley Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.
50511 Dwight Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys. [Texts warehouse worker, Nate, to forget showing up as zwarte piet]

50514 Darryl [Talks drunk angry] Jim, that guy. [Scoffs] You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? [Sighs] It's awful.
50515 Dwight Take a bowl and pass it down.
50516 Phyllis Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.
50517 Dwight No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
50518 Jim Oh, it's like naughty or nice.
50519 Dwight No, impish or admirable.
50520 Jim Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
50521 Dwight I decided earlier.
50522 Jim Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
50523 Dwight Of course I checked it.
50524 Jim But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.
50525 Dwight I checked it more than once.
50526 Jim Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
50527 Dwight Impish or admirable.
50528 Jim Damn.
50529 Dwight Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. [Jim claps] There you are.
50530 Phyllis [Takes here gift out of her bowl] Oh. What are these?
50531 Dwight It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
50532 Phyllis I'd rather have the bowl.
50533 Dwight You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year [looks over at Angela, then back to Oscar]...as impish! [Smacks Oscar with a stick]
50534 Oscar Ow! You hit people with that thing?
50535 Dwight No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder [puts a mouse trap in Pam's bowl]
50536 Jim Ooh.
50537 Pam [Holds the mouse trap up] Mouse trap.
50538 Dwight In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
50539 Jim Oh, you know what? I gotta go.
50540 Dwight Stop giggling.
50541 Pam Oh, really? Already?
50542 Jim Yeah, it's all right.
50543 Dwight It's a punishment. [Turns to Jim] Hey, where are you going?
50544 Jim I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
50545 Dwight But you work tomorrow.
50546 Jim Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.
50547 Dwight But we were gonna break the pig rib.
50548 Jim Ooh.
50549 Dwight Remember?
50550 Jim That's right.
50551 Dwight No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
50552 Jim Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.
50553 Dwight Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
50554 Jim You know what? Yeah. Have at it.
50555 Dwight Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! [Jim holds his hands like a bowl] I judge your year as impish. [Hits Jim with stick]
50556 Jim Ooh! Are you nuts?
50557 Dwight [Hits Jim three more times] I judge you impish!
50558 Jim Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
50559 Dwight They're not abandoning the party. [Hit's Jim again]
50560 Jim Just--Just--Hey!
50561 Jim [As he's walking out] That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
50562 Dwight [Hits Jim some more] Impish! [Chases Jim out]

50629 Angela Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?
50630 Dwight What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
50631 Pam Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.
50632 Dwight Just lice Pam?
50633 Dwight Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
50634 Dwight Make way, nope, inspect me.
50635 Erin Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.
50636 Dwight Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant]

50651 Phyllis What are you wearing?
50652 Dwight It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
50653 Nellie No.
50654 Kevin No.
50655 Dwight Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.

50683 Pam I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.
50684 Dwight Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
50685 Erin No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...
50686 Dwight To be burned!
50687 Erin To be washed.
50688 Angela What do we do about our heads?
50689 Dwight I'm not gonna lie. Lye!

50708 Pam Okay.
50709 Dwight Let's talk pubes, people.

50740 Erin [handing out mayonnaise jars] Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.
50741 Dwight Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]
50742 Stanley Put those away before you hurt yourself.
50743 Dwight [swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!

50781 Meredith Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.
50782 Dwight [talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.
50783 Pam Is there a volume knob on that thing?
50784 Dwight Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.

50789 Meredith Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.
50790 Dwight Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]
50791 Erin Dwight, are you okay!?
50792 Dwight Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]

50812 Darryl I'm back together with Val. Yay...
50813 Dwight I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]

50833 Kevin Well I can't stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.
50834 Dwight Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They're a family owned business [chuckles]. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We'd go in pretending to be family â€“ brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
50835 Angela Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?
50836 Dwight [on phone with Jim] I hope you've been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it's time for another episode of "Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire".

50839 Stanley It's all gone. I didn't get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.
50840 Dwight Oh, god, this again? You're Stinky.

50843 Angela Shut up!
50844 Dwight Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.

50847 Oscar Everybody shut up and work!
50848 Dwight Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?

50851 Kevin Yeah!
50852 Dwight How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.

50855 Stanley Hey, it's five o'clock. [everyone leaves and a traffic backup occurs in the parking lot]
50856 Dwight Mmm. That's a good... question. 300 times... [Jim hangs up] 180... Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.

50860 Darryl Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim's company.
50861 Dwight Yes! We did it! [leaving the suit store]

50864 Darryl Why don't you come along and tell him yourself?
50865 Dwight And you closed it. The boys are back in town. [high fives Clark] High fives! Ha ha!

50868 Erin Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.
50869 Dwight You got me! [tickles Clark and chuckles] I used to collect them!

50872 Erin What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it's in order? I [laughs] haven't been trained for this.
50873 Dwight Each one is very different, like a snowflake.

50892 Oscar Actually, it's pronounced "espresso"... Wait. That's what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So...
50893 Dwight There he is! [chuckles] We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but...
50894 Clark If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.
50895 Dwight Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh... No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
50896 Clark [sarcastically chuckling] I loved it.
50897 Dwight How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
50898 Clark If it'll lead to me being a salesman, I'll pretend to be your friend.
50899 Dwight Then looks like we have a deal... Son [holds up a suit identical to his]

50911 Suit Store Father [chuckling] It's kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store.
50912 Dwight You know, you're right! We hadn't even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]
50913 Clark No, we sure hadn't Pop. [both chuckling]
50914 Dwight [Takes picture from desk] Oh! You're a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark's shoulder]
50915 Clark He calls me Clarky â€˜cause he's my Dad.
50916 Dwight Guilty!
50917 Suit Store Father You don't meet many hunters these days.
50918 Clark My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he's like a serial killer... of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick! [Dwight imitates sawing and blood spurting out of his neck, then makes a dying noise]
50919 Dwight It was his birthday, just turned three. So...

50957 Jim [back to Pam] Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.
50958 Dwight ...But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark's getting out of my car. He's a good boy, does whatever I say.
50959 Suit Store Father [sighs] I can't relate to that, my son hates my guts.
50960 Dwight Oh... really.
50961 Suit Store Father Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?
50962 Dwight [fumbling] Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they're not even good. Really, they're bad. Like you and your son.
50963 Clark [enters] Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but... God I missed you!
50964 Dwight What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
50965 Clark [confused] I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.
50966 Dwight You're being disrespectful!
50967 Clark ...And I love you, for saying that.
50968 Dwight [whispers to Clark] We don't get along.
50969 Clark [catches on] Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is... our relationship is... terr-
50970 Dwight Terrible!
50971 Clark Terrible.
50972 Dwight Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!

50997 Clark Well, I understand, but â€“
50998 Dwight I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
50999 Clark Here we go again, another lecture from the old man.
51000 Suit Store Father Listen to him. He created you.
51001 Dwight Maybe if you listened a little bit, you'd improve. No wonder women despise you.
51002 Clark Women don't despise me...
51003 Dwight His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam's apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn't see it, or didn't wanna see it.
51004 Clark Alright, that's enough, â€˜cause I can say some things about him too.
51005 Dwight Yeah? Like what?
51006 Clark Like the time that you got drunk and, and then... Killed those kids on their way to prom!
51007 Dwight That never happened. He's always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught "saving treats" from the kitty litter box.
51008 Suit Store Father Really shameful...
51009 Clark So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-
51010 Dwight Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
51011 Clark There's obviously a volume discount uh, if you-
51012 Dwight Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going "please kitty, may I have some more?" You can't make this stuff up!

51015 Suit Store Father Here he is, my son.
51016 Dwight [scoffs] Got cat turd collector written all over him.

51044 Suit Store Son I'm sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper?
51045 Dwight Do you mind? The men are talking.
51046 Suit Store Father Sons used to idolize their fathers.
51047 Dwight Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
51048 Suit Store Father I'd love to! Sam Junior here, he runs the business now. Kind of pushed me out, truth be told. I'm just here for human contract.
51049 Suit Store Son Okay Pop...
51050 Dwight Wait, so you're the boss?

51081 Suit Store Son [to Clark in dressing room] That's Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful... Although expensive.
51082 Dwight Yeah, you don't want Italian. You'll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you'll be doing life in Rikers Island.
51083 Clark Well, that's better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.
51084 Dwight That place doesn't exist. It's not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
51085 Clark [emerges from dressing room wearing a sharp black suit] How do I look?
51086 Dwight Actually... You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I'll take one too.

51098 Pam [reluctantly] Everybody dance now... [Darryl continues singing]
51099 Dwight Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. "Scranton Mimeograph Corp?" I don't think we're doing business with them any time soon. That's odd.  A letter from Robert Dunder. "A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance." The Holy Grail.

51107 Jim Hey.
51108 Dwight Aha! A lightbulb.

51111 Jim We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it.
51112 Dwight A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. [holding note over lamp] Invisible ink.

51115 Jim I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.
51116 Dwight "Higher than numbers go." The ceiling above accounting!

51127 Jim Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.
51128 Dwight An "X."

51131 Jim Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video.
51132 Dwight Oh.

51135 Jim Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it.
51136 Dwight "Sedes introiti." Seat of entrance.
51137 Pam I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.
51138 Dwight [shouts while cutting up seat cushion - gasps upon finding playing cards]

51153 Pam Yep.
51154 Dwight Let's just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice]

51187 Guy [on video] I nailed that guy, dude. Oh yeah.
51188 Dwight Pfft, "Athlead"? Please. They're too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it "Stumpany," for "Stupid Company."

51191 Guy [on video] Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! I nailed that guy, dude. Oh, yeah.
51192 Dwight You're working for "Stumpany" too?
51193 Darryl [sighs] I'm gonna miss the paper business.
51194 Darryl Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I'm switching over.
51195 Dwight What?
51196 Darryl Yep.
51197 Dwight [on phone] Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
51198 Jim Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.
51199 Dwight You won't stop until you've poached us all.
51200 Jim Yeah. Even you.
51201 Dwight No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me.

51242 Nellie Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man.  "Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously." I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.
51243 Dwight Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
51244 All [murmuring]
51245 Dwight You're welcome.
51246 Phyllis Wait. This says "Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge"?
51247 Dwight This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
51248 Oscar "Loyalty pledge"?
51249 Darryl Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.
51250 Dwight Yeah, we'll see about that.
51251 Dwight Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? "Infuriating, irresponsible"...
51252 Clark They got us set up with Windows 95,  so you're kind of dreaming here.
51253 Dwight Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out.
51254 Dwight [writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean?
51255 Kevin Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches.
51256 Dwight Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.

51259 Mr. Romanko Thank you. Thank you.
51260 Dwight No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl?  L--
51261 Darryl Loyalty.
51262 Dwight Loyalty.
51263 Nellie Loyalty is exactly right.
51264 Dwight Thank you.

51270 Mr. Romanko I'm sorry. Do I still need to be here?
51271 Dwight Yes.
51272 Nellie I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let's-- let's use an example. Take Erin. Erin's boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.
51273 Dwight Yeah.

51292 Pam Shh! Kids are dancing.
51293 Dwight Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
51294 Darryl Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.
51295 Dwight It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
51296 Darryl It can.
51297 Dwight Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?

51318 Darryl All right, let's get this over with.
51319 Dwight You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!
51320 Dwight Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
51321 Darryl How far is this place? [turns off radio]
51322 Dwight Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]

51335 Nellie I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.
51336 Dwight Yes. Fast food. I'll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
51337 Darryl They have fast food in Philly.
51338 Dwight Not like this.
51339 Darryl Exactly like this.
51340 Fast Food Worker And your milkshake.
51341 Dwight Thank you.
51342 Darryl It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake?
51343 Dwight Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!
51344 Dwight Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
51345 Darryl You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.
51346 Dwight It's a youtube thing! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, they're coming.

51362 Erin Hello, Peter.
51363 Dwight [cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
51364 Darryl You missed a spot.
51365 Drive Thru Customer Fire in the hole! [throwing milkshake] Go! Go! Go! Go! [tires screech]
51366 Dwight Ha ha! Yeah, joke's on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!

51375 Toby Lady...you never stop surprising me.
51376 Dwight [sighs]
51377 Darryl [clears throat]
51378 Dwight What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?

51382 Pam Hey Brian, you got a sec?
51383 Dwight Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?

51386 Pam I feel awful.
51387 Dwight Okay.

51418 Clark Hey, so I hear you're bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?
51419 Dwight They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
51420 Dwight That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.

51423 Pam I'm good.
51424 Dwight Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
51425 Dwight Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee.
51426 Dwight Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, "Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses." Wow.
51427 Clark Oh, I'm sorry. You gotta be this cool for coffee.
51428 Clark You know what, man? I deserve this job.
51429 Dwight [scoffs]
51430 Dwight Mm-hmm.
51431 Pam Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?
51432 Clark I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond... and under.
51433 Dwight Who, me?
51434 Dwight You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
51435 Pam Us.
51436 Dwight Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor â€“ he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants.
51437 Dwight Absolutely, I do. [giggles]
51438 Clark This sucks, you know? You put in 12 grueling weeks at a company, and what do they do? They make you compete for a promotion, like an animal. You know, I thought this was an office, not the Thunderdome.
51439 Pam Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that.
51440 Dwight Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
51441 Dwight Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that's great.
51442 Jim You could've just called that an alliance too, right?
51443 Pam [shushes]
51444 Dwight I chose my words very carefully.
51445 Pam & Dwight [laughs]
51446 Jim Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse.
51447 Dwight Aah!

51450 Rolf No. You're interviewing for it. I'm getting it.
51451 Dwight Welcome to the club, pig! [laughs]

51454 Rolf I'm Rolf. Rolf Ahl.
51455 Dwight Aah!

51459 Clark There he is.
51460 Dwight Hey. Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F, you're literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]
51461 Rolf Nice.
51462 Dwight Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.

51466 Jim Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix â€“ me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So... problem solved. Thanks, guys.
51467 Dwight And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
51468 Jim I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.
51469 Dwight No doy!
51470 Jim I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.
51471 Rolf I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don't do earbuds.
51472 Dwight [laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh]
51473 Jim I'm sure he's just nervous.
51474 Pam [sighs] It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.
51475 Dwight So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything.
51476 Rolf Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me?
51477 Dwight Well, I'm the one offering the job.
51478 Rolf What are your credentials?
51479 Dwight I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
51480 Rolf I think I've heard everything I need to hear.
51481 Dwight Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference.
51482 Rolf Thank you, Dwight. I'll be in touch.
51483 Dwight Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, "Jump," and he says, "Oh who?" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
51484 Dwight What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?
51485 Trevor Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.
51486 Dwight Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
51487 Trevor Pass. Next one.
51488 Dwight All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
51489 Trevor No, no and no.
51490 Dwight There were only two options.
51491 Trevor Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?
51492 Dwight This is a bus transfer.

51511 Jim I looked at you coming around, and I said, "Wintergreen."
51512 Dwight I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
51513 Dwight Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
51514 Clark That's just a classic no-win situation.
51515 Dwight Thank you.
51516 Clark So I'd Kobayashi Maru it.
51517 Dwight Damn it! Perfect answer, again.
51518 Clark Yep.
51519 Dwight Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ...
51520 Clark You know what, Dwight?
51521 Dwight And anothâ€”
51522 Clark This interview's over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru'd the whole process.
51523 Dwight No.
51524 Clark Yeah. Star Trek rules.
51525 Dwight It does, but still no.
51526 Clark Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?
51527 Dwight Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here.

51534 Meredith [chuckles] Walked right into that one.
51535 Dwight Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise.
51536 Dwight What quality would make you a good sales associate?
51537 Mose People person.
51538 Dwight It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
51539 Mose That's right.
51540 Dwight You know we live together, right?
51541 Mose Yes.
51542 Dwight And I've never seen you go to work, ever.
51543 Mose Okay.
51544 Dwight So why is this on your resume? [door slams]

51555 Clark X-Men school?
51556 Dwight When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.

51567 Jim Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some inputâ€”
51568 Dwight [presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.
51569 David Wallace Hey, Dwight. It's David.
51570 Dwight David.
51571 David Wallace Jim says he'd like some say in the hiring process.
51572 Dwight Really? That's interesting. â€˜Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.

51577 Jim Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.
51578 Dwight Sounds fair to me, David.
51579 David Wallace And I know we have a call scheduled for later â€“
51580 Jim Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later.
51581 Dwight No. Why not do it now?
51582 David Wallace Yeah. What's up Jim?
51583 Jim Uh... [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?
51584 Dwight I'd love to be in the loop, David.

51588 Jim Yes, okay. Bye.
51589 Dwight [whispers] I'd love to invest.
51590 Jim No, thanks.
51591 Dwight I'd like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing]

51598 Jim Dwight, you can't just hire someone â€˜cause they're your friend.
51599 Dwight I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
51600 Nellie They're freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.
51601 Dwight You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
51602 Darryl Your friends are like Spider-man, if he had gotten bitten by a spider and then got really into m*st*rb*t*ng.
51603 Wolf Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch.
51604 Dwight Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
51605 Dwight Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of â€˜em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
51606 Dwight Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
51607 Wolf Do you want this paper?
51608 Dwight I sure do.
51609 Wolf It's not very good.
51610 Dwight I will pay you whatever it takes.
51611 Wolf I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.
51612 Dwight No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
51613 Wolf Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It's over.
51614 Dwight Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?
51615 Wolf I am.
51616 Dwight Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]
51617 Hide I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University.
51618 Dwight This isn't gonna work out.
51619 Hide Thank you. [chuckles]
51620 Dwight Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps
51621 Dwight [groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]
51622 Melvina Do you need to be changed?
51623 Dwight I do that myself now.
51624 Melvina Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car.
51625 Dwight No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.

51628 Wolf Yeah, whether it's me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvinaâ€”
51629 Dwight Or none of you [chuckles]
51630 Wolf Yeah, you'd bring us all down here, put us through the wringer and then choose none of us.
51631 Trevor Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.
51632 Dwight I wish I could hire all of you.
51633 Zeke I could start Monday.
51634 Dwight Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
51635 Jim Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say.
51636 Dwight Just act natural. [grunts]
51637 Dwight And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
51638 Jim But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.
51639 Dwight Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call.
51640 Jim Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?
51641 Dwight I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
51642 Jim I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.
51643 Dwight Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
51644 Jim Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?
51645 Dwight Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
51646 Jim And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.
51647 Sensei Ira I'm sorry?
51648 Dwight What? This is such bullcrap!
51649 Jim Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.
51650 Dwight Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
51651 Jim Too much now.
51652 Dwight Okay.
51653 Nate Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.
51654 Dwight Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
51655 Jim That seems inconsiderate.
51656 Rolf No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don't open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe.
51657 Dwight Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.

51716 Pam [entering office] Conference room. Everybody. Now!
51717 Dwight You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
51718 Pam Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.
51719 Dwight You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
51720 Pam Yeah.
51721 Dwight Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!

51737 Pam [as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.
51738 Dwight Pam, I'll help you.
51739 Pam You will?
51740 Dwight If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.

51746 Pam I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.
51747 Dwight [enters quickly] You need my pitchfork?
51748 Angela [approaches Dwight as he leaves] Hey!
51749 Dwight What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
51750 Angela Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.
51751 Dwight Ah, I'm not interested.
51752 Angela What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.
51753 Dwight If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]

51757 Angela Aw, crap.
51758 Dwight [in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
51759 Frank You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there. [gestures mural]
51760 Dwight Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
51761 Glenn I'm not drawing a butt.
51762 Nellie All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.
51763 Dwight Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
51764 Val OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.
51765 Dwight Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
51766 Nellie Well, this is getting us nowhere.
51767 Pam We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.
51768 Dwight We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief]
51769 Pam See, I feel bad about that.
51770 Dwight It's all right. It's all right.
51771 Nate So, she's gonna pull through again? [all nod] That's great. Can I talk to her?
51772 Dwight No. She needs her rest again.
51773 Nellie Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.
51774 Dwight You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.

51778 Pam All right. You can go. Give him his gum.
51779 Dwight There's no gum. There never was any gum.

51815 Pam That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.
51816 Dwight Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
51817 Pam We should just take him down.
51818 Dwight Wait. Are you saying...
51819 Pam I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.
51820 Dwight Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
51821 Dwight He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
51822 Pam Yes!
51823 Dwight A little eye for an eye action.
51824 Pam Yes!
51825 Dwight Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
51826 Pam We need an infiltrator.
51827 Dwight I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark]
51828 Pam Clark?
51829 Dwight He even looks like a mole.

51857 Jim Oh, crap. Were those yours?
51858 Dwight [pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
51859 Clark Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.
51860 Dwight Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.

51865 Clark What lines?
51866 Dwight Go move some paper!

51873 Pam Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck!
51874 Dwight Great. Get the plate number.
51875 Pam OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?
51876 Dwight So we know which truck to van...

51891 Pam I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?
51892 Dwight Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
51893 Pam Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.
51894 Dwight Let's see yours.
51895 Pam Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.
51896 Dwight This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
51897 Pam Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.
51898 Dwight I saw that. That's great!
51899 Pam Yeah. I feel better.
51900 Dwight Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
51901 Pam I know. You miss Angela, don't you?
51902 Dwight Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his pen1s.

51950 Erin [bursts into Andy's office] We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.
51951 Dwight [knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.
51952 David Wallace [on phone] Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?
51953 Dwight [talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
51954 Dwight [pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
51955 Dwight I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.

52013 Brian Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.
52014 Dwight [to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
52015 Dwight [acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
52016 Andy [in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.
52017 Dwight You're back. [surveys Andy] And you're disgusting.

52029 Andy Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes gÃ¼iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]
52030 Dwight Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
52031 Andy Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.
52032 Clark Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?
52033 Dwight No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?

52048 Andy I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.
52049 Dwight Thank you.
52050 Andy And you sold it to Jan too.
52051 Dwight Yes!
52052 Andy I mean... I'm impressed.
52053 Dwight [laughing together] Yeah!
52054 Andy Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.
52055 Dwight You were on a boat.
52056 Andy I was...
52057 Dwight On a boat.
52058 Andy That...
52059 Dwight In the ocean.
52060 Andy OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.
52061 Dwight I'm not gonna say it.
52062 Andy Say it.
52063 Dwight Not a word.
52064 Andy Coolio.
52065 Dwight No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?
52066 Andy Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.
52067 Dwight Don't you dare! Andy!

52074 Jan Hmm.
52075 Dwight [whispers] Coolio.
52076 Jan Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?
52077 Dwight Coolio. Coolio.
52078 Andy No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.
52079 Jan Yeah.
52080 Dwight Coolio.
52081 Andy It, it's, it's actually just an issue...
52082 Jan You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.
52083 Dwight No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.

52086 Andy Well, ah, ah...
52087 Dwight Please Ja, Ja... [Jan hangs up]

52097 Andy Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.
52098 Dwight Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
52099 Clark [emotional] Do you have any idea what I had to do to get that sale from Jan? I mean, I went all out. All out. I mean like everything was out the whole week.
52100 Kevin He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?
52101 Dwight God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
52102 Dwight I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.

52107 Erin Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.
52108 Dwight Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.

52117 Andy I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.
52118 Dwight Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.

52128 Kevin You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank...
52129 Dwight [interrupting] ... lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
52130 Andy What?!
52131 Dwight Yeah.
52132 Andy There was a fire in the warehouse?
52133 Dwight The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.

52181 David Wallace ...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
52182 Dwight Yes ma'am.

52277 Mark You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that's just being Pam. Well I'm kinda cute and I'm- but I'm married so...leave that be.
52278 Dwight [on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
52279 Pete Hey. You got a sec to talk?
52280 Dwight [Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.

52283 Pete Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
52284 Dwight And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.

52287 Erin Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
52288 Dwight It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.

52291 Pete Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
52292 Dwight You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was "poisoned" by Aunt Shirley.

52295 Pete Yeah.
52296 Dwight Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.

52299 Pete I do think we can have a fair....
52300 Dwight Thank you.

52303 Mark Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don't- not allowed to ask. So...
52304 Dwight Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-

52307 Mark You're not.
52308 Dwight And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.

52311 Mark I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.
52312 Dwight There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.

52315 Mark Don't be afraid, it's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-
52316 Dwight It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?

52319 Mark It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.
52320 Dwight It's a divet...

52323 Mark Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show?
52324 Dwight ..where it was and it needs, it needs a...

52333 Angela Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
52334 Dwight How dare you?

52391 Kevin I'm Kevin.
52392 Dwight Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.

52399 Erin What, do you two know each other?
52400 Dwight This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!

52403 Erin Oh.
52404 Dwight OK

52407 Erin That's so random.
52408 Dwight You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.

52415 Gabe Hello beautiful.
52416 Dwight Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?

52419 Gabe We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
52420 Dwight Ok.

52423 Toby Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
52424 Dwight Yeah, trust me.

52427 Clark So Pete was a librarian?
52428 Dwight It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.

52478 Andy Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.
52479 Dwight And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.

52482 Andy Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
52483 Dwight By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?

52486 Clark Hmm.
52487 Dwight Would you like the stink sack?

52490 Pete It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
52491 Dwight No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.

52520 Jim You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
52521 Dwight Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.

52524 Jim [touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
52525 Dwight Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.

52528 Athlead Coworker Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line.
52529 Dwight Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.

52532 Pam Bye.
52533 Dwight I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
52534 Angela Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
52535 Angela I made a vow. I gave my word.
52536 Dwight In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
52537 Dwight Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
52538 Shirley [coughs and laughs in her sleep]
52539 Angela Good night, D.
52540 Dwight Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.

52543 Pete It is so unpleasant. You?
52544 Dwight No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.

52643 Jim You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
52644 Dwight It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.

52647 Jim Austin Powers.
52648 Dwight You'll see. Here we go.

52651 Jim Ferris Bueller.
52652 Dwight Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.

52655 Jim Not Night at the Roxbury.
52656 Dwight Let's get to it.

52659 Jim I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
52660 Dwight Give it a whirl.

52665 Pam He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
52666 Dwight I need you to hose my aunt.

52669 Pam Mmhm.
52670 Dwight OK you are useless.

52673 Pam I don't know.
52674 Dwight Give me the hose!

52677 Pam I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.
52678 Dwight Ahh! OK!

52681 Pam Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
52682 Dwight [as elevator door closes] Hold it!
52683 Creed [notices something new about Dwight] New glasses.
52684 Erin Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
52685 Dwight I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
52686 Pam Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
52687 Dwight I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
52688 Dwight My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
52689 Jim My condolences.
52690 Dwight Keep them.
52691 Jim OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
52692 Dwight In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.

52696 Oscar [while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
52697 Dwight Excuse me?
52698 Oscar I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
52699 Dwight OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]
52700 Oscar I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
52701 Jim [as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
52702 Dwight I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
52703 Jim OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
52704 Dwight I miss her so much.
52705 Jim OK.
52706 Dwight You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
52707 Mose [playing guitar and singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning'] Zeke's here.
52708 Dwight Zeke.
52709 Zeke Hey, Dwight. Mose, Mom says 'hi'.
52710 Mose 'Hi' to Mom.
52711 Dwight Are you going?
52712 Mose Will there be ghosts there?
52713 Dwight [simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
52714 Zeke You get in the sidecar.
52715 Dwight Get...
52716 Dwight [at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
52717 Oscar You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
52718 Dwight [smirking] Oh, yeah.
52719 Oscar [as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
52720 Dwight Jeb, my brother.
52721 Oscar You have a brother?
52722 Dwight Uh-huh.

52739 Jeb [gathers and tastes soil] Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here.
52740 Dwight Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
52741 Jeb Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all.
52742 Dwight Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
52743 Jeb It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow.
52744 Dwight Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
52745 Jeb Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any.
52746 German Minister Would the family care to say something?
52747 Dwight You had black hair and then gray hair.

52750 Fannie [approaches and hugs Dwight] I see you started without me.
52751 Dwight You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?

52759 Zeke Blugh.
52760 Dwight [to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
52761 Henry Dwight.
52762 Dwight I see Esther's back in town.
52763 Esther Hi Dwight.
52764 Dwight Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
52765 Esther This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn.
52766 Dwight Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
52767 Fannie We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here.
52768 Dwight OK.

52771 Henry Land size? [all shake heads] [removes hat] Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's. [replaces hat] OK. [drives away]
52772 Dwight So, let's get it going.
52773 German Minister [approaches Fannie, offering a shotgun] Would you want to do the honors?
52774 Fannie Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this.
52775 Dwight We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.

52796 Aunt Shirley [on a recorded video] Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city.
52797 Dwight [agreeing with Shirley] Thank you.
52798 Aunt Shirley Jeb. A street pusher.
52799 Jeb After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out "worm" means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of... pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management.
52800 Dwight I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.

52805 Jeb Snap out of it. Dwight?
52806 Dwight Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
52807 Fannie No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy?
52808 Dwight Of course you are.
52809 Fannie Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication.
52810 Dwight Oh my god.

52813 Jeb Totally. Yep. The people here are like [makes farting sound, laughs] Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart?
52814 Dwight You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
52815 Jeb Couple of nights couldn't hurt.
52816 Fannie Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt.
52817 Dwight You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.

52820 Fannie That doesn't work on me.
52821 Dwight OK.
52822 Fannie By the way, that's not...
52823 Dwight [counts down in French]
52824 Fannie Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui.
52825 Dwight Oui.
52826 Fannie Oh my goodness.
52827 Dwight [while everyone is gathered playing and singing "Sons & Daughters"] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.

52849 Cameron [after following Dwight to the chicken coop, before sunrise] Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them?
52850 Dwight Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
52851 Cameron I was just asking you something I didn't know.
52852 Dwight Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
52853 Cameron [after grabbing an egg] Are we gonna eat these today?
52854 Dwight If you want.
52855 Cameron Is that a guillotine?
52856 Dwight This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
52857 Cameron [referencing goat] That's a cow?
52858 Dwight Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
52859 Cameron [after seeing Dwight smelling milk] What are you doing now?
52860 Dwight Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
52861 Cameron I don't know.
52862 Dwight Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
52863 Cameron I don't know any of that.
52864 Dwight OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?

52897 Fannie Not it.
52898 Dwight It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.

52907 Ryan Howard That'll pay for the exploding helicopter.
52908 Dwight [Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.

52921 Ryan Howard Yeah, that's better. A bunch of hot women go
52922 Dwight Phyllis is m*st*rb*t*ng. In the office right now as we speak.

52937 Jim I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
52938 Dwight OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]

52941 Jim We'll look into it.
52942 Dwight It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.

52949 Jim We're gonna go get him.
52950 Dwight Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.

52953 Jim We're gonna get him.
52954 Dwight Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
52955 Dwight Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
52956 Clark Sweet.
52957 Clark A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
52958 Dwight Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
52959 Dwight Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
52960 Clark Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
52961 Clark Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
52962 Dwight Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
52963 Dwight By hand.
52964 Clark Oh.
52965 Esther Dwight, we need to talk.
52966 Dwight [laughs] What do you think?
52967 Dwight I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
52968 Clark The same thing that you think.
52969 Esther Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends.
52970 Dwight A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
52971 Dwight No.

52974 Angela Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
52975 Dwight That snake!

52978 Pam [on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
52979 Dwight That shady grove out by Willard's pond.

52982 Pam I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
52983 Dwight So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?

52986 Pam [laughs] Um.
52987 Dwight [laughs] No!

52990 Pam You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
52991 Dwight Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]

53047 Pam I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. [at computer opens translator. Types in "Elskere" which comes back as "lovers" Pam smiles]
53048 Dwight Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
53049 Angela I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
53050 Dwight Did I tell you about her teeth?
53051 Erin Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
53052 Angela Yes.
53053 Dwight Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.
53054 Mr. Ruger Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls.
53055 Dwight Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.

53130 Mr. Ruger Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns.
53131 Dwight Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
53132 Mr. Ruger Esther, get in the truck.
53133 Dwight Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]

53139 Andy Oh! Seven new comments. "The guy at 0
53140 Dwight Security deposit. That's been-
53141 Mr. Ruger Standard.
53142 Dwight Right, standard.
53143 Clark Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
53144 Dwight No.
53145 Clark One second.
53146 Dwight No.
53147 Clark One second.
53148 Dwight I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
53149 Clark Don't do it. [takes Dwight's pen]
53150 Dwight What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
53151 Clark Dude, we're being conned.
53152 Dwight Go on.
53153 Clark These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
53154 Dwight No.
53155 Clark Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
53156 Dwight What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
53157 Clark I don't even know what an auger is!
53158 Dwight No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
53159 Mr. Ruger Hey, you ready to sign?
53160 Dwight I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]

53220 Erin Didn't you get the memo? It's Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
53221 Dwight [laughs] Right? Come on!             
53222 Erin Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It's a... "Mageddon!"
53223 Dwight Yeah, maybe I'll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it's the most pleasant I've ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.

53247 Andy Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
53248 Dwight Well, the alert was already set to "Red" because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to "Double Red"?

53259 Andy It doesn't include headshots.
53260 Dwight What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news...thing.

53266 Andy It's okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?
53267 Dwight You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn't even know it. I'll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.

53270 Andy I want you to print that out for me.
53271 Dwight Wellâ€”no, noâ€”nâ€”

53274 Andy Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation's Lisa Loeb.
53275 Dwight [stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.

53280 Stanley [walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
53281 Dwight Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could've met in the lobby. It's time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
53282 Stanley Son, you've lost your mind. I'm not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
53283 Dwight The buyer is your sister's friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that's an order.

53317 Angela All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I'm a better wife than that. [sighs]
53318 Dwight Andyâ€”[knocks] I need to talk to you.
53319 Andy Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. 251. 252. I can't even keep up!
53320 Dwight Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
53321 Andy [grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That's final.
53322 Dwight So what I'm hearing you say is, "Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible"?
53323 Andy Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent.
53324 Dwight Mm-hmm. Good luck.
53325 Andy [on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
53326 Dwight For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts.
53327 Clark Hey, Dwight.
53328 Dwight Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
53329 Stanley Pass.
53330 Clark Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
53331 Dwight Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
53332 Stanley Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you haâ€”
53333 Dwight [fires tranquilizer gun at Stanley]
53334 Clark Holy [bleep].
53335 Stanley No, you didn't. Sick of you and yourâ€”oohâ€”
53336 Dwight [fires tranquilizer gun twice]
53337 Stanley [falls to the floor with a loud thud]
53338 Dwight It's all right. Andy approved it.
53339 Meredith Man, he's really in twinkle town now.
53340 Clark Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
53341 Dwight Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do.
53342 Clark You gave him three shots.
53343 Dwight Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let's go!
53344 Clark All right.
53345 Dwight Move it! One, two, three. [grunts]
53346 Dwight He's like a manatee. Ready? Let's go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley's head hits the door frame] Oh, God.  No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
53347 Clark We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
53348 Dwight Yes.
53349 Dwight [grunts] Okay, we're good. We're good. Let's go. Push!
53350 Clark I am!
53351 Clark Any good weekend plans?
53352 Dwight I might see a movie.
53353 Clark Nice.
53354 Dwight What about you?
53355 Clark Uh, I don't know yet.
53356 Dwight [grunts] Let's take himâ€”
53357 Clark I was thinking about...
53358 Dwight Let's go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
53359 Clark And then what?
53360 Dwight Okay, listen. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I've never actually done this before.
53361 Clark Well, if I may, you're a natural.
53362 Dwight Thank you. I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh...
53363 Clark That's a little weird.
53364 Dwight I know. Evel Knievel.
53365 Dwight [wraps tape around Stanley's body]
53366 Clark [connect helmet straps around Stanley's head] That's about as good as that's gonna be.
53367 Dwight Okay, now here's the plan. I'm gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
53368 Clark Catch?
53369 Dwight Yeah.
53370 Clark I can't catch him. He's like, 250 pounds.
53371 Dwight You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He's gonna be moving slowly. It's onlyâ€”
53372 Clark Blunt?
53373 Dwight It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicineâ€”
53374 Clark Dude, this size of my haunchesâ€” [Stanley's body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]
53375 Dwight Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
53376 Clark We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
53377 Dwight [slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?

53421 Angela [gags]
53422 Dwight Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We're running late. Let's get him inside.
53423 Clark We can't just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
53424 Dwight Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
53425 Clark That's actually really smart.
53426 Dwight Thank you.
53427 Clark God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
53428 Dwight Let's get him inside.

53441 Clark Hey, wait, wait, howâ€”how are we doing this?
53442 Dwight Well, I'll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
53443 Clark Just say "arms" and "legs," okay? That justâ€”that's the vernacular that I'm comfortable with.
53444 Dwight Fine, let's go. [grunts]
53445 Clark [sighs]
53446 Dwight Hoist his shank on three.
53447 Clark Whaâ€”What's a shank?
53448 Dwight It's by the tenderloin.
53449 Dwight Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he's slouching. Okay, can youâ€”sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
53450 Clark All right.
53451 Dwight Got it?
53452 Clark Yeahâ€”yup yup.
53453 Dwight [grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
53454 Clark What?
53455 Dwight Get in the back.
53456 Clark Aw, come on.
53457 Dwight Get in.
53458 Clark Damn it.
53459 Dwight Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we're about to do?

53462 Stanley Pigeons.
53463 Dwight Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we've got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
53464 Clark Isn't the client, like, best friends with his sister?
53465 Dwight New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let's go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let's go.

53473 Toby [whispers] That they do.
53474 Dwight And forâ€”oh, whoopsie daisy. [chuckles]
53475 Mrs. Davis Stanley, what is going on here?
53476 Dwight He's fine. He gets carsick really easily.
53477 Clark Driving.
53478 Dwight It's a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we're talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
53479 Stanley Ooh-hoo, look at that baby...
53480 Dwight Stanley.

53484 Mrs. Davis Very special little boy.
53485 Dwight Look at him. I've never seen such a beautiful child.
53486 Mrs. Davis Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he'll go, "eee."
53487 Dwight Like this? Watch.

53496 Erin [grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
53497 Dwight Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.

53539 Robert Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh?
53540 Dwight I'm pumped!

53554 Angela I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
53555 Dwight I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.

53573 Kevin Yes!
53574 Dwight Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself?
53575 Kevin Uh huh.
53576 Dwight Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.

53580 Nellie Oh man.
53581 Dwight I call for a refold!

53584 Kevin This is flatter.
53585 Dwight It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.

53591 Erin Nice.
53592 Dwight [clapping] Whoo!

53610 Andy Tom Brokaw!
53611 Dwight Come on Clark!
53612 Angela Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
53613 Dwight Whoa!

53623 Angela No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
53624 Dwight Watch and learn.

53627 Nellie Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
53628 Dwight Yes!
53629 Angela Whoo!
53630 Dwight Oh, Esther.
53631 Esther Hey.
53632 Dwight What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.
53633 Esther Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow.
53634 Dwight I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]

53658 Esther [to Dwight] Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?
53659 Dwight Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
53660 Esther Oh. Is she a gambler?
53661 Dwight In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.

53670 Darryl I believe I want to go home.
53671 Dwight [throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.

53702 Nellie Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.
53703 Dwight After you.
53704 Angela Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
53705 Nellie Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight.
53706 Dwight [fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
53707 Esther We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted]
53708 Dwight Alright.

53727 Pam It's great.
53728 Dwight Just wait and send it to voicemail.

53731 Pam The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
53732 Dwight Come on. Come on.

53735 Pam Nice morning, too.
53736 Dwight [climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]

53747 Andy Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
53748 Dwight Pam.

53751 Andy Tell me about it, you know? I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
53752 Dwight Thank you, Jim.

53755 Oscar [noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
53756 Dwight Get out of Jim's seat.

53759 Kevin Wait, all of them?
53760 Dwight You're an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we'll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.

53763 Oscar That'sâ€”that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry.
53764 Dwight So...

53767 Kevin I've never met anyone like that.
53768 Dwight I wanted to offer you a new position.

53771 Oscar Angela, you still have your son.
53772 Dwight Assistant regional manager.
53773 Angela I guess.
53774 Jim Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job.
53775 Dwight Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher andâ€”
53776 Dwight Jim.
53777 Jim Smasher!
53778 Jim I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take.
53779 Dwight Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
53780 Dwight Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
53781 Dwight I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
53782 Jim Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
53783 Dwight I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
53784 Dwight So, all the numbers adding up?
53785 Jim Fireball!
53786 Oscar Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but... congratulations, Dwight.
53787 Dwight Ah! [throws punch] That's how it's done.
53788 Dwight Thank you.

53795 Erin Lately, I've been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy's calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
53796 Dwight Yes, it is. Carry on.

53897 Andy All right. I get it.
53898 Dwight [whispering] You okay?

53908 Phyllis No, he's good.
53909 Dwight He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!

53912 Oscar Good night, Kevin.
53913 Dwight Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]

53916 Oscar Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
53917 Dwight Just slip it off myâ€”Slip it off my hips.

53920 Oscar Wait a minute. You're not thinking of living in aâ€”
53921 Dwight He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.

53924 Oscar Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
53925 Dwight There it is. [everyone applauds]

53928 Oscar Come stay with me.
53929 Dwight We did it, we did it. I love you.

53932 Oscar I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won't be long. It's the least I could do.
53933 Dwight Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You're gonna watch me right?

53936 Oscar Separate bathrooms.
53937 Dwight Sensei, you're not watching.

53940 Oscar You're welcome. Let's go get Phillip. Then we'll get your stuff...
53941 Dwight Watching?

53944 Oscar And get you the hell outta that place.
53945 Dwight Watch this part, okay?

53949 Sensei Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world.
53950 Dwight Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.

53962 Jim What?
53963 Dwight You did not just say that! You don't know Pam. She is really cool.

53966 Jim Oh, my god!
53967 Dwight Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It's out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see Jim as manager.

54016 Jim You come so prepared. Aspirin.
54017 Dwight You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
54018 Jim Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great.
54019 Dwight Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job?
54020 Jim No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
54021 Dwight Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed.
54022 Jim I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying.
54023 Dwight Hello.
54024 Andy Well, hello.
54025 Dwight Big day for you.
54026 Andy Big day for you.
54027 Dwight Thank you.
54028 Andy Love the belt.
54029 Dwight Oh, yes.
54030 Andy You know, I don't know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out!
54031 Dwight This is exciting! You're finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
54032 Andy Thank you, I appreciate that. â€˜Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
54033 Dwight Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who've tried to be a star. But, listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
54034 Andy No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
54035 Dwight Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don't quit your day job.
54036 Andy [cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
54037 Dwight You're bad.

54046 David Wallace Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
54047 Dwight Say it again.
54048 David Wallace Will you be the new manager?
54049 Dwight Where?
54050 David Wallace Where?
54051 Dwight What branch?
54052 David Wallace Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news.
54053 Dwight I'm sorry. I've just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
54054 David Wallace What?
54055 Dwight But this isn't interim manager. No. It's Dwight K. Schrute... [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
54056 David Wallace Why do you already have this?
54057 Dwight In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
54058 David Wallace I know.
54059 Dwight I will never, ever let you down.

54103 David Wallace Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schruteâ€”
54104 Dwight David. Can I just do one thing while you're making this announcement and then I'll never, ever do it again?
54105 David Wallace I don't think so.
54106 Dwight It's just one thing. Just let meâ€”let me do thisâ€”

54112 Bartender How many people want the game? [half the bar cheers] Who wants PBS? [other half cheers] Sorry. Tie means I do nothing.
54113 Dwight Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project

54118 Andy One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
54119 Dwight But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.

54124 Kevin Yes!
54125 Dwight This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?

54130 Andy Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.
54131 Dwight The coffee in Paraguay is colder?

54136 Kevin I feel scared a little.
54137 Dwight Ah, much, ok.

54142 Stanley No one is ready for this. You can't be ready for this. We don't even know what this is.
54143 Dwight No, no. Give me the steam.
54144 Oscar One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
54145 Dwight It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
54146 Jim Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of "Pilot"]
54147 Dwight [while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!

54161 Stanley He ain't coming.
54162 Dwight Oh, don't worry. They'll get got.
54163 Erin Oh, god!
54164 Dwight Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check... on that later today. This is my grandmother's ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring.

54175 Meredith Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
54176 Dwight You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
54177 Darryl Oh, oh, I'm sure we did.
54178 Dwight Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.

54181 Clark Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
54182 Dwight Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World Warâ€”

54185 Darryl Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that's on me. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you're feeling sentimental.
54186 Dwight Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.

54205 Kevin Don't tell me what to do!
54206 Dwight Welcome.

54209 Kevin No, I don't need this! And you obviously don't need me.
54210 Dwight Please take an agenda item.

54213 Kevin Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
54214 Dwight Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. "Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try." [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.

54218 Pam Question.
54219 Dwight Smart baby. That's the most flavorful bond.

54227 Casey No, I know.
54228 Dwight [as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?

54237 Andy Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
54238 Dwight Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.

54242 Meredith I'd better come out of this smelling like a rose. I've been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn't for the cameras, I would've done some truly vulgar crap.
54243 Dwight Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
54244 Stanley Over the course of this documentary I've had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble
54245 Esther Dwight, I'm telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?
54246 Dwight I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
54247 Dwight The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
54248 Kevin Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
54249 Dwight [puts his grandmother's ring away] Thank you, Esther.

54255 Casey Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! [singing] Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you.
54256 Dwight I need you to perform a test.

54259 Casey America wants it!
54260 Dwight On an innocent baby.

54263 Casey [singing] Casey Dean!
54264 Dwight Damn straight.

54267 Casey Man, those are some nice pipes.
54268 Dwight Hey, he can handle it.

54277 Oscar Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
54278 Dwight Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.

54285 Angela Why don't you pack it?
54286 Dwight Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager's office before?
54287 Kevin Guys.
54288 Dwight Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called "Schrute or Consequences." You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?

54291 Kevin Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says "bold front" instead of "cold front"? It's insane.
54292 Dwight Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.

54300 Check-in guy But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America's Next A Cappella Sensaâ€”
54301 Dwight Not now! Private time!

54304 Check-in guy Okay.
54305 Dwight Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]

54308 Check-in guy No, you're not, sir.
54309 Dwight Which is, of course...

54312 Check-in guy Please don't.
54313 Dwight Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.

54316 Check-in guy I'm not touching you. Okay? [Andy makes a break for it]
54317 Dwight The power source.

54320 Oscar Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
54321 Dwight A loyal, but bungling apostle.
54322 Dwight That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
54323 Jim But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
54324 Kevin He's not that smart. He doesn't know where I hid his duck.
54325 Dwight Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.

54328 Santigold What is this?
54329 Dwight I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?

54332 Aaron Rodgers No, you're a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.
54333 Dwight I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?

54336 Clay Aiken No, we do not want to hear you sing.
54337 Dwight That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's the sanest thing I've ever heard.

54384 Kevin That was a really cool move.
54385 Dwight That means ye, Plop!

54388 Kevin Whoa.
54389 Dwight We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?

54398 Angela No, Kevin, no.
54399 Dwight You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.

54402 Kevin Whoa!
54403 Dwight Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.

54406 Angela Stop it.
54407 Dwight You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it.

54426 Erin Absolutely.
54427 Dwight Not even close, Meredith. Come on!

54433 Jim Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
54434 Dwight Door. Chair. It's about Phillip.
54435 Dwight Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job.
54436 Angela I am sorry he's here today but I hadâ€”
54437 Jim That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
54438 Dwight I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.

54441 Jim Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
54442 Dwight Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet.

54445 Jim Come on.
54446 Dwight Very well.

54449 Jim Whoa. How did you know that I was gonnaâ€”
54450 Dwight Yes.

54455 Clark Yeah.
54456 Dwight Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.

54459 Clark I would love a corn dog.
54460 Dwight [throws "now" beanbag at Jim] Now.

54463 Clark [reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went."
54464 Dwight Jim. I'm not kidding. I need you.
54465 Dwight No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations.

54471 Andy Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
54472 Dwight I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.

54475 Andy What?
54476 Dwight She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest.

54479 Andy Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
54480 Dwight Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.

54483 Andy Me too. Hold my place in line.
54484 Dwight And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.

54487 Andy They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
54488 Dwight Angela.

54492 Darryl Yep. Take care.
54493 Dwight Some sort of virus?

54496 Darryl Hey.
54497 Dwight Oh.

54501 Pam Aha. How's Athlead?
54502 Dwight You're a good assistant, Jim.

54505 Pam Wow.
54506 Dwight That's very true. Get the hell outta here.

54521 Pam Thank you.
54522 Dwight A thousand times more.

54531 Meredith See you guys at Poor Richard's, all right?
54532 Dwight [over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?

54535 Angela Okay, bye.
54536 Dwight [running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!

54550 Meredith Hey! No way!
54551 Dwight [in bullhorn] Pull over!

54554 Erin Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
54555 Dwight Move to the side of the road!

54558 Erin Get upstairs, mister!
54559 Dwight Pull over!

54564 Darryl Guess I'm going upstairs.
54565 Dwight [on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman!
54566 Jim You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thingâ€”none of these people are good enough.
54567 Angela Who drives like that?
54568 Dwight I know.
54569 Dwight Listen to me! I love you! And I don't care that Phillip's not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
54570 Jim What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said.
54571 Angela Can you put that down?
54572 Dwight Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
54573 Dwight This expresses how loudly I love you.
54574 Jim Is-
54575 Angela It's too loud.
54576 Dwight Me.
54577 Dwight [puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
54578 Jim The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
54579 Angela Okay, yesâ€”yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
54580 Dwight Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.
54581 Dwight I love you!
54582 Jim I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That's it. You look really, really good.
54583 Angela And I lied to you.
54584 Dwight Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
54585 Dwight What?

54588 Pam Hey.
54589 Dwight What? Why would you say thatâ€”

54592 Pam Are you happy?
54593 Dwight [excited] Get out! I'm a dad!

54607 Bartender What's it about?
54608 Dwight The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
54609 Dwight You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.

54612 Jim Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet.
54613 Dwight Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you've been here. That's the max.
54614 Dwight pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.
54615 Dwight Waste of a good hatchet.

54619 Jim Hey, and if you're ever in Austin...
54620 Dwight PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
54621 Kevin Well, w...
54622 Dwight Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn.
54623 Dwight In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a "where are they now" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go.
54624 Dwight I heard you say "well" the first time.
54625 Jim There it is.
54626 Dwight [mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
54627 Jim I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.
54628 Dwight Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So... have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So...yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
54629 Kevin Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
54630 Dwight It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.

54635 Meredith Speech!
54636 Dwight No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
54637 Darryl You did good. Real good.
54638 Dwight No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...Kevin.

54641 Kevin Yes! Wait, why?
54642 Dwight That's it.
54643 Andy I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.
54644 Dwight Go ahead and just read the frosting.

54647 Kevin "Get out."
54648 Dwight I missed you Kevin.
54649 Creed [walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
54650 Dwight Uh-huh.

54653 Kevin What does that mean?
54654 Dwight Ohh.
54655 Jim Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes...and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's...an amazing gift.
54656 Dwight It's a colloquial way of saying "you're fired," Kevin, which you are.

54659 Jim Thanks Phyl.
54660 Dwight The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.

54664 Angela Do you even have a mattress?
54665 Dwight Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.

54668 All Dwight...[overlapping objections]
54669 Dwight You've had your drink. Now where is my bride?
54670 Kevin Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I'm gay.
54671 Dwight Based...on his merit.
54672 Dwight Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]

54680 Kevin I'm...good.
54681 Dwight No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.

54688 Creed [still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
54689 Dwight Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake. [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.

54714 Pam I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much.
54715 Dwight That is all. Have a good morning.

54718 Kevin [laughing] Yeah, people hate you.
54719 Dwight [after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?

54722 Man Hey! It's Andy Bernard!
54723 Dwight Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.

54726 Andy Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
54727 Dwight Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him.

54730 David Wallace It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it.
54731 Dwight I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band "The Grass Roots" in the 1960's. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
54732 Dwight With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.

54754 Pam Oh, um, well, you know, I... I just... I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
54755 Dwight Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight.

54760 Man 3 Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore?
54761 Dwight Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.

54855 Andy Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
54856 Dwight [chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]

54859 Andy Hmm.
54860 Dwight Oh, no. What?

54863 Andy No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
54864 Dwight Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing.
54865 Dwight What? Ooh!
54866 Jim I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you-
54867 Andy Surprise!
54868 Dwight Not... significant is a big word...
54869 Dwight I thought you guys couldn't come.
54870 Jim I think it's definitely... Well, okay. Either way...
54871 Darryl Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
54872 Dwight I think you're only a teeny...

54875 Darryl You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
54876 Dwight Jim.
54877 Dwight Uh, better ask Jim.
54878 Jim I just...really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
54879 Jim And Jim will say nothing.
54880 Dwight [turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can't believe you came.

54897 Darryl Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are...for real.
54898 Dwight Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab â€˜em on in there.
54899 Jim Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to.
54900 Oscar Whoo, whoo, whoo.
54901 Dwight Everybody!

54913 Ryan Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
54914 Dwight Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary.

54917 Kelly Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
54918 Dwight Jim...wha... Come on! What...what are you gonna whack me, Jim?

54921 Kelly I don't know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn't look so good.
54922 Dwight A bazooka. You remembered.

54925 Kelly You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
54926 Dwight [tearful laugh]. Get out of my way.

54929 Pam [with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it's choreographed!
54930 Dwight Woo! Okay!

54937 Toby [dancing with Pam] [sobbing]
54938 Dwight Amazing.

54980 Angela People love it.
54981 Dwight Good night.
54982 Rachel They do.
54983 Toby Good luck.
54984 Dwight [sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
54985 Val Great. It was really fun.
54986 Stripper Hi, boys!
54987 Dwight Good evening.

54991 Darryl Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
54992 Dwight Oh, Thank God. We are famished!

54997 Meredith You have to go, Toby.
54998 Dwight No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special? [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]

55001 Val Come on.
55002 Dwight Oh, we do. So we'll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.

55005 Pete There he is!
55006 Dwight Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?

55009 Jim I gotta get out of this dress.
55010 Dwight Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good.

55063 Jim Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]
55064 Dwight Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic.

55067 Pam We're so excited.
55068 Dwight You're telling me!

55071 Woman Oh, that's for PBS executives only.
55072 Dwight What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?

55089 Stanley Okay, I need a drink.
55090 Dwight Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]

55093 Meredith Hey, bottom drawer.
55094 Dwight Good old Mose. [laughing]

55097 Pam [answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore.
55098 Dwight Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.

55101 Kevin If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural.
55102 Dwight A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
55103 Dwight Hey guys.
55104 Jim Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?
55105 Angela Hi.
55106 Dwight Right. Which one is that?

55111 Angela Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
55112 Dwight Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
55113 Dwight Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?

55117 Darryl Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
55118 Dwight Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender! [Kevin turns around] Oh.

55121 Andy [on the computer] You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
55122 Dwight I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.

55125 Jim Athleap.
55126 Dwight [to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
55127 Pam And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially...
55128 Jim Ooh.
55129 Dwight No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired!
