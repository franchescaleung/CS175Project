To use the formatted Dwight text in training your chatbot, you need to change where the program pulls its input text,

normally it has the following datafile = os.path.join(corpus, "formatted_movie_lines.txt"), but if we put formatted_Dwight.txt in the same directory all we need to do is change it to:
datafile = os.path.join(corpus, "formatted_dwight.txt")

and voila.  The text is in need of some cleaning no doubt, and I have doubts as to how well it will train a chatbot without being supplemented with additional training data.
