People say I am the best boss. They go, "God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious." "And you get the best out of us." I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.	Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum
Whassup!	Whassup!
Whass...up!	Whassup.
Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?	What?
What are you doing?	Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
It's not on your desk.	It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.	You can't do that.
Why not?	Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
We'll see. This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.	Downsizing?
Downsizing?	Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.
Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.	I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.	OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
Can't you just tell us.	Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
You don't know what it is.	OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
I don't need your permission.	Go ahead.
Can you promise that?	On his mother's grave.
Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.	Pam, information is power.
Introduce yourself. Be polite.	Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.	Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
That's his profit.	New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.	Damn it! Jim!
OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?	He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
nan	That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.	It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.
What is that?	That is my stapler.
No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.	OK you know what, you can be a witness. Can you reprimand him?
How do you know it was me?	It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
Discipline. Kinky! All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.	Yeah.
Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.	OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
Do you really have to do that right now?	Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... Hello? Thanks, Dwight.	Retaliation. Tit for tit.
That is not the expression.	Well, it should be.
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.	I have two. White and Indian.
Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.	A few of the ground rules?
Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.	OK, can we steer away from gay people?
Um...	I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.
Well, we only have an hour.	I figured it would save time.
Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.	Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?	A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
OK.	A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.	We all have a hero in our heart.
No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.	Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.	Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
That's nice, Dwight.	OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
OK, I like your food.	Outback steakhouse. I'm Australian, mate!
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.	Oh, man, am I a woman?
Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.	Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.
Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.	OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.	OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.	Yes, I have an office. Bigger than his.
Nope, you cannot use it.	OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
Temporary workspace. You can use it.	Thank you.
If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.	What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.
What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.	In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead." Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
Dwight, what...	Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.
It says "workspace".	Same thing.
If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?	Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
You are not my superior.	Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?	Yes. And my decision in final.
This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.	Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?	Sure.
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?	Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.	I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?	So I can lower it.
Is it a good plan?	It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?	Yeah, you said...
No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?	I can handle that.
Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, "Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I... love him.	OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.	OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?	Damnit! Damnit Jim!
Damnit! Damnit Jim!	All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.
What are you talking about?	Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?	Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.	You did this, didn't you?
Absolutely not.	Yes you did.
No I didn't.	I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
It's an epidemic.	The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. "Count Choculitis"
Sounds tough.	Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Do you?	I think you need to confess...
Mmm hmm.	...the fact...
Yep.	What are you doing? Those are my keys.
Good luck.	Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let...
Jim Halpert.	Let me out.
Who is this?	Let me out or you're fired.
No, you can't fire me.	Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
Hey Pam! How are you?	Jim! Open the door!
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?	Jim!
I have nothing to do.	Jim!
Oh great. Um, no, this weekend? Nothing. I'm not really doing anything.	Jim!
The mall?	Jim!
Hello?	Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
This is Jan.	Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
Who is this?	Dwight Schrute.
From sales?	Well...
Where's Michael Scott?	He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Dwight, listen to me very carefully. You are not a manager of anything. Understand?	That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
Really?	Yeah.
OK, when Michael gets back, you tell him to call me immediately.	Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
No. Please don't use my cell phone ever again.	Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your...
Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.	Michael. Michael?
Oh, Christ.	I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.
I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.	I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.
What about confidentiality?	You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted pen1s.
Could you mean v*g1n*? Because if you do, I want that covered.	I thought your v*g1n* was removed during your hysterectomy?
A uterus is different from a v*g1n*. I still have a v*g1n*.	OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? a**l fissures?
That's a real thing.	Yeah, but no one here has it.
Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?	I most certainly did not.
Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. "Hi. I'm Mork from Ork." Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.	Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.
Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.	Michael!?
Oh! God. Dwight, come on...	I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
There's no downsizing.	I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.	Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
But there's no downsizing, so just don't...	Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, "You're fired." "You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed." It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. "You're foir-ed." I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, "You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want." But that's unrealistic, so...	It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.
Why'd you do this?	I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?	Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.
Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.	Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
Absolutely, I do.	Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.	Did you get your tickets?
To what?	The gun show.
And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says "No, Jim, here's a way."	There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.	Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?	Did you tell Pam about the alliance?
What? No.	Just now.
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.	Right, that's good, good, pursue this.
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?	Mmm hmm.
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.	Done.
Can you get her? She's right there. That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, "Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers." Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, "Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael."	They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?
Yeah, what do you think that's about?	Only one way to find out.
You are not going to believe this.	What? I believe it.
Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.	I could tell, from the body language.
Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.	Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...	Oh, they're forming an alliance
Their bread is very good.	Damn it. God!
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.	God... Damn it! Why us?
OK, yeah.	Jackpot.
Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.	Hey, you wanted to see me?
Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?	I don't think she'd be missed.
There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.	Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.	She had a hysterectomy.
Which one is that again?	That's where they remove the uterus.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?	It could be kind of funny.
OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.	Oh my God, we have to be there.
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.	No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
What? What?	I know. I know exactly what to do.
Great.	I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.
I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.	This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.
Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.	So tape it down.
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.	Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?	No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
Right... That's good.	Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.
Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...	Oh.
An alliance? What the hell is he talking about?	I have absolutely no idea.
Come on.	Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.
Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.	That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. Very good. Excellent, excellent.	Michael!
Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.	Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.	Oh, please.
When I let him come to my pick-up game...	I apologized for that.
I vouched for you.	Michael, I...
I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.	I can handle that.
Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.	And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.	Same thing.
No, it's not. It's lower, so...	It's close.
It's close.	So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.
I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.	Gimli.
Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.	Just trying to be helpful.
No, no, ridiculous.	Michael, look. Missed it...
Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.	Yes!
Sorry Phyllis.	Can I be team captain?
No, I'm team captain.	Can I be team manager?
No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.	Assistant team manager?
No.	OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.	OK, we'll be skins!
Aw, come on Dwight.	What? Shirts on or off?
On. Just put it on.	You sure?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. Here we go. Three! Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!	De-fense! De-fense!
Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!	Yeah! In your face!
Dwight!	Yes!
This is a cold pack...	Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag.
We've created an incentive program to increase sales.	Hey, how's it going? Good. Can I talk to you for a second? In private?
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.	It will just take a second.
Uh, yes. Yes you can.	Just for a minute.
No, Michael. No. You can't win this prize.	Please? I wanted to talk to you in private because I wanted to ask you out on a date.
Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.	Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?
Ok was that no to talking to me in private, or was that no to the date?	s*x.
It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing.	Torture.
Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.	Cocks in the henhouse.
You sit out there, don't you?	So am I.
Okay, um...	Doesn't matter.
What are you doing?	The purse girl hits everything on my checklist. Creamy skin. Straight teeth. Curly hair. Amazing breasts. Not for me, for my children. The Schrutes produce very thirsty babies.
She'd be perfect for you.	Hmmm... she's been talking to Michael a lot.
So, what? You're Assistant Regional Manager.	Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Well, you know what Dwight? He's your work boss, okay? He is not your relationship boss.	That's true.
Plus you have so much more to talk to this girl about, You're both um, salesmen. I mean that's something right there.	True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.
Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her. If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.	What's that?
You buy a purse.	I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.
Dwight, that's not necessarily true. Do you read GQ?	No.
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright? Lots of guys have them.	Like those?
Yes. Listen, you are spending way too much time talking to me, when you could be talking to her.	Okay, I'm just going to use the bathroom, and then I'm going...
I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..	It's actually better this way.
No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---	Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it's against the rules and everything. Because...
No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.	Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.	What?
She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.	Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...	Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
No. I cannot promise you that.	You cannot promise me, or you won't promise me?
Listen, Dwight.	Do you love her?
Oh my God! You are so drunk!	Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.	Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
And here we have Stanley the Manly. Now Stanley is a Dundie all-star, aren't you Stan? Why don't you, ah, show them some of your bling.	Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
Oh, no you di-int.	It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
To Oscar Martinez it's the "Show Me the Money" award! Yeah!	Ahh! I can't-
...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...	Watch your step.
Live and learn.	Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall.	So, what's the joke? You're not perfect either.
Oh, here she is. Careful, careful, whoa. Alright, easy. Almost there.	So who are we laughing at?
Shoot.	Who? Dave Barry?
Um, I just wanted to say thanks.	What is it? Who wrote it?
Alright.	That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
Dwight, get out of here!!	No, no, no, no...
What were you doing in the ladies room?!	...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
Why were you peering over the stalls?!	No, why were you in there?!
You are a pervert!	What were you doing in there?
You, are, a pervert!	I am not.
Oh, lazy. Uh huh.	Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible. Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall. Having a bathroom is a privilege. It is called a ladies room for a reason. And if you cannot behave like ladies, well then you are not going to have a bathroom.
You're taking away our bathroom?	We are going to have two men's rooms.
But where would we...go?	Be prepared to hold folks From 9 am to...
Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.	Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
Just don't, don't talk-	...for people's behavior.
Don't talk-	And it's-
Okay, look, I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year. How there is no money, and how there is no food, and how the jokes are really bad, but WHAT THE HELL EVERYBODY!? I mean, God. The Dundies are about the best, in every, one of us. Can't you see that? I mean, okay, we can do better. so, tonight, for the first time, we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us.	Yes!
Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.	Best Dundies ever.
Best Dundies ever.	Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.
Welcome to the eighth annual Dundies awards.	Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it. Devon!
"You down with The Dundies? You down with the Dundie-"	The waitress tripped on the cord.
Shut it. Um, good. Speaking of relationships, of all, all way shapes and forms. Um, I was out on a very, very hot date with a girl from HR, Dwight.	Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.	Yeah?
And I was about to take her bra off...	Yeah!
...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-	Like an AIDS test?
Then we can go to dinner.	So the monkey does the s*x thing right here!
There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh...	Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?
No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.	Consider it?
Hey, send me that link to the monkey s*x video. I'm going to forward it like it's hot.	Yes!
I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.	Yeah, Meredith.
No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?	Yes.
That's what she sai Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.	Hey, Toby.
Hey Dwight.	You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Sure.	Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female v*g1n* look like?
Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.	Good. Good. And...
I should get back to work.	Okay.
Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.	What is going on?
Ok. Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.	That's my stopwatch.
Here you go. All done.	Diversifying. Smart.
Yeah, I filled out the expense reports. That took about five minutes and then I closed two sales at lunch time. So, about as productive as any other day. If not more so.	And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
You know.	You should go.
Really?	Uh huh.
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one. Congratulations to Michael, because he closed on his condo. So, gold medal.	You have your lawyer there?
And for Dwight Schrute, the silver medal.	Can I be your representative?
I don't need a representative.	Silver medal.
Silver medal.	I think I should be there.
Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.	I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
Those are the doves.	Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.
Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.	So you're taking a personal day?
Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.	Please, I'll make you proud.
Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.	Yes! As your representative?
As my associate.	Same thing.
No it is not.	I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart
Ok. See you soon.	What kind of shocks you got on this baby?
I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?	I want to put the top down.
What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please...	But then no one can see us.
I... Just... Would you put it up? Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.	Check it out. Terminator.
Home, sweet home.	Which one's yours?
Nice to meet you too.	This is smaller than your old place.
Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.	Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for s*x.
Are we ready to sign some papers?	Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.
Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.	Let's go check out the master bedroom.
This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.	Oh. Terrible idea.
I'm putting my bed right over here.	No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.
Well, then I will get a warrantee.	Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.
Well then I won't get a warrantee.	Shh Shh.
So that's the problem, is solved. What?	Listen. Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
And then, I just need you to sign here at this arrow.	What kind of mortgage did you get?
Ten year fixed, over thirty. Thirty year total.	Ho, thirty years.
Ok, ok, ok.	Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.
Alright.	Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.
Ok. Alright. Oh boy.	Well, this is it.
Actually yes.	Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.
Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.	We'll be here waiting for you.
Oh, man.	A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.
I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.	Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?
There's something else Dwight wanted to talk to you about. I have a surprise for you, for helping me out today.	You didn't have to...
Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.	I don't even know what to say.
I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.	Question. Where can I put my terrarium?
What the hell is a terrarium?	It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.
Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.	Question. My grandparents left me a large number of armoires.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.	Question. What about carpooling, who pays for the gas?
We take separate cars.	Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
Why would we do that?	Just for fun?
No.	Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.	Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.
A little bit more and I would have had it.	You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm. We paid it off early.
Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.	People love beets.
Nobody likes beets.	Everybody loves beets.
Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.	Let's get this roof going.
Stop it!	Ow.
How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.	Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.
And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.	nan
Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.	Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.
Michael and I have a very special connection. He's like Batman, I'm like Robin. He's like the Lone Ranger, and I'm like Tonto. And it's not like there was the Lone Ranger, and Tonto, and Bonto.	Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.
Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.	People!
People!	That's exactly what I said.
Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?	This is not a test! Move to the exits!
This is not a test! Move to the exits!	Were you absent?
Toaster Oven 101?	Head towards the exits.
Head towards the exits.	You failed?
I am so sorry.	Get up off your desks!
Do not panic.	I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!
Ryan started the fire! It was always burning---	No, panic is warranted!
No, panic is warranted!	Everybody!
I can't believe I started the fire.	This is not at drill!
Arms at your sides! Arms at your sides!	... Marilyn Monroe!
... Marilyn Monroe!	Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively!
Go, let's go.	Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!
Eat it! You gotta eat it. You have to eat it!	This whole place is a tinder box, it is ready to blow!
Hi!	This is not a test! Can you leave?!
How are you?	DO YOU WANT TO DIE?
I'm good. It's good to see you.	Do you want to die? OUT!!
I'm hungry.	STANLEY! Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Oh, I have been thinking the whole way over and I have my answers.	Move to the exits!
Um, for the... the desert island.	We've got smoke! We've got smoke! Smoke! Gah! Oh, Kelly! You're okay! I've got you!
Okay, um, first, Legally Blond.	Cover your nose and mouth. Breathe through your nose.
Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?	Breathe through your nose. Remove your stockings. Okay? They'll melt right into your flesh! Stay below the smoke line. Let's go! Clear out, stat! STAT MEANS NOW!
Alright.	Okay, guys, listen up, we need a head count. We need to count off. Michael's number one. Where is he? Where is he?
Ah... adapt, react, re-adapt, act.	Answer me this, though.
What?	Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.
Hey, Michael. Um... Ryan needs his number for the count off.	Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?
Was it worth it?	NO!
NO!	Really?
I'm really sorry, Dwight.	Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.
Okay, he can have 14. Marjory's not here today.	The fire guy! The fire guy!
Well, he needs a permanent number, right?	Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe, Ryan started the fire!
Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.	Oh, you know what else? I thought of a nickname for the three of us. Three Musketeers.
Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.	That's funny, too. But if we're the Three Musketeers...
Would You Rather. Would You Rather is our third game.	Hey guys, great response time. Listen up, I got some theories. Okay, there's a...
I would take The DaVinci Code... so I could burn The DaVinci Code.	Okay. Great, that's going to keep you warm for like 7 seconds. Question
I guess.	Then I would bring an axe, no books.
Uh, it has to be a book, Dwight.	Fine. Physician's Desk Reference.
Nice. Smart.	...hollowed out, inside
...and Ghost. But, ah, just that one scene...	Is this your car, Ryan?
Don't...	Good shocks.
Come on, egghead. Let's do it.	Do it.
Is it cheaper to sign a new customer? Or to keep an existing customer?	Keep an existing...
Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.	Yeah, but look, I mean, he didn't need business school. Okay, Michael comes from the school of hard knocks.
Okay, Dwight.	Self taught. You didn't even go to college.
You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.	Come on. I'm studying with the master, huh?
For instance, why don't you go to business...	You should learn from him, right?
I am.	Right?
Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.	Stupid!
Play by the rules. Dwight. All time favorite movie.	The Crow.
Sometim... .	Why didn't I go to business school?
Who goes to business school?	The temp.
He does?	Yeah, it's all him and Michael talk about anymore.
You know, I bet Ryan thinks to himself 'I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekends'.	He doesn't even know that I do that.
You should tell him.	Oh yeah, Pam. Right. That's going to help things, just talk it out. I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted.
What?	I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.
You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.	Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.
Yeah. You're right.	Thanks you guys. I just need some alone time.
Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...	Would that make you happy?
What's that?	If you had your cell phone, it would make you happy?
Yeah.	I'm on it.
Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.	What is that?! What are you supposed to be?
Oh, yeah.	Yeah, well look... What about me?
What are you? A monk?	I am a Sith Lord. Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
Well, I don't really have two heads. So...	Wait, what are you again? Oh, right... Three-hole PUNCH!
Who do you think it should be?	Jim. Definitely.
No, Jim brings in money.	Phyllis.
Eh.	Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.	One of the warehouse guys.
What? There was someone left off that list? Who?	Who is he saying?
You're right, I didn't even think of him.	No, Michael.
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.	No, not me.
Yeah... I could.	Not Dwight.
I'm not saying that's what he said.	I know that's what he said.
What?	Tell him, not Dwight.
That is not a very nice thing to say about him.	Tell him to stop.
Are you kidding?	Quiet, you.
I agree. He'd land on his feet.	Make him be quiet.
Um... Whoa. Michael Scott here. Yes, I am regional manager of this orifice. Mmm hmm. Dwight Schrute is amazing. Yeah. No, he is actually the single greatest employee of his generation. Mm hmm. You know what? I'm gonna tell you what. You hire Dwight K. Schrute, and if he does not meet, nay, exceed every one of your wildest expectations, well then, you can hold me, Michael Gary Scott, personally and financially responsible. Okay. Okay. Okay-kay-kay-kay-kay. Okay.	Stanley, could you come with me, please.
No.	As Assistant Regional Manager...
To the.	Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go. I'm serious, Stanley. It's over. I'm sorry.
So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?	He wouldn't listen to me
Ahh, come on.	If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just...	Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?
Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?	Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.
Oh.	So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis...
Jim...	This is called leveraging an offer. Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?
Oh, God.	I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
Fantastic!	And I turned it down.
What?! That would've solved all my problems.	Out of loyalty to this company...
Oh, you idiot.	... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.	But then you wouldn't have me here.
Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?	It's in Maryland.
You can call. Can you call 'em?	I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
Well, maybe I did.	Where is my desk?
Michael, can't your conversation wait till Monday.	This is not funny. This is totally unprofessional.
Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.	I didn't lose my desk.
I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.	Okay, who moved my desk?
I don't care.	Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot, hot, very hot.	Of course.
Of course.	Dwight Schrute.
Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.	Michael, I don't know...
Michael, I don't know...	Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
I know.	I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.	It's by the ream?
Uh, yeah, ream.	I'll have Pam send out a memo.
I'll have Pam send out a memo.	...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.	Just a formality.
Just a formality.	Wash your hands, Kevin.
Right, oh let me just check the pricing list. Hold on one second...	Michael, I have so much to learn from you.
Michael, I have so much to learn from you.	Sensei, hello it's Sempai...
Umm...	Thank you, Sensei.
Thank you, Sensei.	Dwight...
I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.	Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
Was that your mom?	No, that was my Sensei.
Oh, I thought it was your mom.	I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.	Assistant Sensei.
Ok.	I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.
Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?	Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
No I'm not.	Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this	Ok, give that back to me.
Ok, say please.	No. That is not a toy.
Please?	Please?
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.	Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.
Could you practice on the forms?	No women or children, unless provoked.
Ok, Roy?	Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.
Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.	Because we're friends.
Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.	Argggg!
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?	What belt are they?
Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...	No!
... he cried at the end of it. He did.	Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.
Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?	Ok, I'll punch you.
Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.	Kiyah!
Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!	Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.
Yeah. Thank you.	I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.
Yes.	Take this pen and stab me with it.
Hi-yah!	Good.
Wow, that's actually pretty cool Dwight.	Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.	I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.
No, Really?	In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.	Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!
Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches	No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
Really?	Yeah.
No, they must have class.	No, it's free during the day. It's fine.
Look...	I've got the key.
Ok, gentlemen, listen up. After a clean strike to the chest, stomach, or kidneys, I will separate you and award a point. The first person to three wins. Alright?	Yes, Sensei!
Shi mate!	Hiii!
What the hell was that?	Yes!
No.	Eat it!
Alright, that's the way you want it.	Two more.
I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.	No.
I got his pants.	It was my pants.
Ok, break. Break.	No holding.
You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. Eight points. Nine points.	No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
Open your mouth.	No, Michael!
Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?	I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.
Ok, to what?	Just put "The Hospital." Contact number
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?	I'm busy.
Ok, let's do this thing. Wish us luck.	Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
Oh yeah-	Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
Why not, Dwight? This is a movie. I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.	You took something that doesn't belong to you.
Dwight-	Brought it in here-
Do you want to play-	Made copies of it-
Sir, you have some messages.	Not now!
They're important.	Ok, what are they?
First message is	Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!
Not in a thousand years, Catherine. We work together. And get off my desk!	Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good.
Yes, I have acted before. I was in a production of "Oklahoma" in the seventh grade. I played the part of Mutey the Mailman. They had too many kids, so they made up roles like that. I was good.	If it isn't my old partner, Samuel L. Chang.
Agent Michael Scarn, you lost some weight.	Thank you for noticing. Now keep me company for one more mission.
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-	Pow! Pow! Pow!
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would be more comfortable in my private jet?	Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface. Sam, get my luggage.
I forget it, brutha.	Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever. And you're disgusting, Dwigt. Wait, who's Dwigt?
Here's what we think happened. Michael's sidekick, who all through the movie is this complete idiot who's causing the downfall of the United States, was originally named Dwight. But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace, but that doesn't work on misspelled words, leaving behind one Dwigt. And Dwight figured it out. Oops.	D-W-I-G-H-T.
D-W-I-G-H-T.	Ok, you know what? I am done with this. That's it, the end.
Well, some of us wanna keep reading, so-	Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement. My uncle bought me some fireworks. Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go. Oh-ok.	Michael? Michael? Michael? His car's not in the parking lot. I should check the accident reports. Who's this? Jan?
Hello, Dwight.	Did you do her?
Who.	Jan Levinson-Gould.
Uh, no, no, no Gould.	Did you do her?
This is none of your affair because she is your boss-	And she is your boss.
Why might some say that?	You should get one of these.
Yeah, no, I don't think you can.	Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life. Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
Wait.	This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core. Sorry.
Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?	Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable s*x.
Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?	Plus, improves your reflexes see, I would have caught that.
Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?	It's only twenty-five bucks.
Because she's conflicted. She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.	I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!
Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again. "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you".	Oh, hey, listen, Jim. Here's a little tip for your performance review.
Ok.	Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.	Oh, yes, we do.
No, we don't.	Yeah, it's a new product. So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.	Uh, that is so stupid. What if he gives it to you?
I win.	Ugh, you know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today. I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday. Uh, stupid.
Wait, wait	Uh, duh.
Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11	Saturday.
No, that was unbelievable.	Who? Who was it? Who did he fire?
You didn't see it?	No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night. Crap! I never go out on a Thursday night
Why are we here? Because I value your opinions. Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do. I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing. Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers. Alright. Number one	What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. That happens occasionally.	It happens occasionally.
Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?	Tom?
Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion.	Next suggestion.
Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O."	You need to do something about your B.O.
Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath"-	You need-
Ok.	To do something about-
Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.	Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.	Next suggestion.
"Don't sl-", ok, that's blank Don't, just put it-	"Don't sleep with your boss"? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Where did you get your outfit?	[loud metal music playing in a stairwell
Look-	Michael?
Oh my God...	I'm sorry, am I interrupting? Oh God
No, Dwight	Great.
What do you want Dwight?	I am ready for my performance review.
You wanna talk now, good	Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?
Why on earth would we give you a raise?	That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking. Let me bring up one word
You do? How do you get in?	I have a copy of your key.
Oh! Michael, for God sakes!	I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?	For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.
That was deer!? Gross, oh!	You liked it!
Oh, did not!	Jan, have you ever had deer?
No.	It's a delicacy. And you know what? It's an aphrodisiac. So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you, I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you. Do you have a light?	And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said "Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of".
That's from Superman?	Smallville. And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Ok.	Mi-
Here I go again on my own. Going down the only road I've ever known...	Sorry.
Oh, yeah I gave that up.	Ok, I'm sorry. What is going on in there? Why is he here? What are you doing?
Yeah, it turns out I was, um, just grasping at straws.	You have to tell me.
Just turn around now, cause you're not welcome anymore.	Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.	Surprise! Everybody!
Dwight...	Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Ok, yeah, this is a duet, so, need somebody else, Pam? You wanna come up and sing this one? Need somebody else. Takers, please. Baby when I met you there was peace unknown. Kelly? Tried to get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside, there was something goin' on. This part goes to the, uh, girl. You do something to me that I can't explain. Hold me closer and I feel no pain. In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on. Tender love is blind---	Or get hit by a car-
We're making love!	Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.	So it's true? You have access to our e-mails?
I gotta erase a lotta stuff. A lot of stuff.	Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.
I know.	Good.
Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.	Nice.
One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental. Who do you think he should choose?	Does he have access to their medical records?
Ummmm...	I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records. As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories. Yeast infections. There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county. Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.
What? Ohhhh... Yes! Thank you!	Question
Oh, uh, no. Could-	I was wondering-
Could, keep that down.	Why?
Because not everybody knows about the party.	Like who? Who doesn't know?
Umm, Michael.	Why just Michael?
Because it's a surprise.	Is it?
Uh hmm.	Oh, that's perfect!
So, don't tell.	I won't.
Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.	Battlestar Galatica.
That's, whatever stupid show you want-	I can't-
To watch tonight	Tonight.
We're watching it.	Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice. Soccer practice.
I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.	Clarinet.
You, too, Dwight?	Have fun tonight! Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. He has no idea!
Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention. We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.	Jim! You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?
Hey, you must be Dwight!	You don't work with us.
Hey, I love the Birkenstocks.	Thanks. Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions. Jim, come here.
Uh hmm.	When is the guest of honor coming?
Oh, uh, later-ish.	He's gonna love it!
I think it's alright. Jesus drank wine.	Go. Get the door.
Here we are.	This is so awesome.
This is so awesome.	Go. Push!
Oh god.	Thank you.
Thank you.	Push!
Merry Christmas, asswipe!	Really shove it.
What's up my nerds. Check it out.	Shove it through! Break it!
Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.	I got a splinter.
Darryl. There you go. You earned it.	I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.	One, two, three.
Is there anything we're missing? Phyllis, you got the lights?	Oh, hello there. But what are you doing?
We'll see.	You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.	Yes.
Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?	You guys should use a hand truck.
Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?	No.
Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.	Michael, I would like to be the elf.
That makes sense because he has elfish features.	Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.
It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.	Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.
I know how to plug something in.	I want to do it.
I think the tree looks nice.	Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, "Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth."	First present, Oscar.
Thanks, Kelly. You know I was gonna get one of ..	Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.
Yep. That's exactly what happened.	Pam.
There's a little more to it.	All right, next. Ryan.
What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?	Michael.
Should we just keep opening up the presents?	We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
And I have to give it to her? I don't have a choice?	Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
That's like, the creepiest thing that I've ever seen.	Angela, you're up.
Damn it.	Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.
I really want the iPod.	It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
"In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute."	You and me, Michael. Yes!
Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?	I never said it was better than an iPod.
I never said it was better than an iPod.	Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.
Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.	Take that, Saddam!
That's the thing I bought myself. I'm really psyched to use it. Maybe I should have taken the iPod. Oh, shoot.	Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.
Okay, well, I guess I will take that book of short stories.	Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
Got to be kidding me.	Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.
I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?	No trades.
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.	"A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane. Titanic.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?	No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
You don't even drink tea.	True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..
Okay ..	.. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so.
Hey.	Hello. Jim?
What's up, buddy?	This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.	Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
Who, Steve?	Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.	No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.	Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
I love these.	Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?
Oh, there it is. J1.	But I don't have any...
Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.	Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
Hello, everyone.	Good morning, Michael.
The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.	Aye aye, Captain.
Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.	Cool.
So, okay.	Limbo, whoo!
Okay...	Me! Me, me, me.
Uh... usually it's a woman.	I'm stronger.
Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!	I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.
Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.	What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?
Hey, come inside and talk to me.	I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.	Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
Okay.	Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
Wow!	Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.
Never, ever, ever give up.	Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.
Yeah, that's right.	Want to take a rake... .
Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.	Ahh!
Ok, wait wait wait wait...	Ok, Pam, thanks.
Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!	You're the best.
Ok...	It smells like chicken soup.
Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.	I have to go to the hospital.
I'm sorry? Pam.	Where we going?
What is going on?	I'll be back, I mean...
OH GOD!	Why?
Oh God!	Aw, Pam, you're adorable
OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.	nan
I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious, it's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.	Oh, huggy hugs.
I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.	Where are we going?
Come on, get inside.	What is going on? What is going on?
What is going on? What is going on?	Where are we going?
Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.	I'm coming Michael!
I know, just sayin'.	I'm gonna save you!
Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.	I found it under the seat.
I found it under the seat.	Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!
I don't want Dwight!	I'm thirsty.
I don't have a girlfriend.	No!
It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.	I'm thirsty!
What was that?!	No.
Ohhhhhh!	You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
It's broken right, he can't...	No.
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!	Mmmmm...
No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.	My eyes!
Please stop popping my cast. Thank you.	My eyes!
Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...	Danger.
Danger.	Your foot?
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.	It slipped.
Come on Dwight.	Sorry.
Sorry.	Hi Michael!
I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.	Ahhh. Mweehaa
A head injury.	Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
So, I'm ordering a CAT scan.	What?
What?	What is that?
Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?	No, I didn't.
Ok, what kinda machine is that?	What is wrong with you?
Where is my cornbread?	That's what she said.
Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?	I don't want to do this.
And they had no yams?	Oh.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.	Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?
Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?	Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.	Oh, no no no. Don't go there. I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
Really? Michael went in with him?	Yeah, I'll write down the address for you. Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
Wow.	Why would they all be...? Ok, see you later, Pan.
Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!	These covers are totally indestructible.
Really?	Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it.
Yeah. Throw it. I promise it won't break. Chuck it.	Oh no, it's broken.
What?!	No, it's fine. I told you it wouldn't break. You could throw it all day long.
That is so cool. Thanks Dwight!	Yep.
No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom. No, I'm not gonna call Jan. She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that? No, it was mutual. What is Pam doing chatting with you?	Huh. Do you like candy?
It's alright.	Cause you're sweeter than candy.
I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!	Dad?
Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.	Uh, ugh, ohhhh...
I, barely know him...	I want Michael to take me...
Slowly, slowly. Let's just get to the elevator.	Choo choo choo choo choo choo...
What are you doing? What, stop...	Vietnam sounds.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.	Tired...
Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?	What's up-dog?
Gotcha! Oh, God. Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?	Good. How are you doing?
Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January	Empty mind.
No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.	Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes. They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?
He's out sick.	That's unacceptable.
Whhh... What are you guys doing?	Michael.
Yes.	Oscar is out sick.
On a Friday?	Can I do some of the talking?
I will do all the talking.	Ok, let him know that I'm here.
Hi, Oscar its Michael.	And Dwight.
Yeah, I feel terrible about it.	Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
I feel nauseous and my heads killing.	Checks out.
I'll just be sleep---	Ok. First impressions?
He sounded sick.	Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
That's exactly what I was thinking.	Question? May I investigate?
Can you hear me, they talk about us...	Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning. Do you think you can handle it?
Yeah, I think I can handle it.	Do you think? Or do you know?
I think.	Oh God, here.
Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.	Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.
Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling. Listen a little question for you, buddy. I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.	There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth. The liar will perspire. Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.
Not so much.	Ok, what is going on here?
Nothing.	Oh, really nothing? Fact
Fact	Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.	Is that true?
Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.	Thank you Michael. I know your telling the truth.
Ok.	I can tell. I won't let you down.
Great.	Who took all the black ones?
That's a communal bowl.	So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.	Sniffling how?
Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?	Three.
Ok, it was the second one.	Ok, good, thank you. That wasn't so hard now was it?
I hate you.	Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.
Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.	Including prep time?
You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.	As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years. One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me. So I tailed her for six straight nights. Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.
Ok.	Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.
Who's this?	This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
Are you going to tell Michael?	How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor. Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.	Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage. Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.
Here she comes. All cleaned? Great.	It's still stinky.
That is worse.	She probably scrubbed it into the fibers of the carpet. Total permeation.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Old bullpen.	Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
Don't ape me.	Okay.
This is great.	Yeah!
The pressures of my office are insane.	Mm.
I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here.	No way!
Yeah.	And who had your office?
You know who used to sit at that desk?	That guy Miles who quit to form his own company?
Mm-mm. Todd Packer.	No!
Yeah.	I thought he was out on the road.
He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes.	Ah.
Dwight.	Michael.
Let's send up Accounting.	What?
Ahhhh! Whoo hoo! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Sales rules!	Yeah!
Yeah! Oh ho ho	Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that.	Okay.
You know what? I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of terrorism against the office. The only thing that makes any sense.	Hello, am I the 107th caller? Hello, Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? Hell , Rock 107. Am I the 107th caller? I'm totally gonna win us that box set.
Stop.	Jethro Tull...
Stop it. Stop. It. Don't. Don't.	I need to make a sales call. Please?
All right.	Am I the 107th caller?
Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?	Yeah!
Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!	It is so on!
God, this is gonna be fun.	Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.	But you're the one who picked today.
I'm just going to put this over there.	It's a terrible idea.
You did uh... okay.	Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.	Yeah!
We have nowhere else Jan. This...	We could do it in the warehouse.
Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.	Remember on Lost when they met the Others?
Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?	Okay. Let's go. Step up.
Well, I'll be honest. One of the goals of these women seminars is to feel out if there's any standouts. Women who could be a valuable addition to our Corporate life.	Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.
Ponies.	No.
How about rainbows?	No.
It totally sucks.	Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like "Gas ain't free!"
No, you don't. You don't feel us. How can you? You know what?	Not literally.
But we get paid a lot less.	Word.
Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.	And you want me to come with you.
Nope. The opposite of that.	I will stay here and run things on this end.
Ok, good.	Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
I probably will, why do you ask?	Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
Yeah.	Screwed.
So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.	What's this? What is this?
I dunno, it's on your desk.	Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
It was there when I sat down.	Happy Valentine's Day. It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! Ahh!
This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were, OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.	Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.	Oh I did. I did.
I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.	Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and...	Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.	No, Pam, Just. Just,
You need to get something for your girlfriend.	Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
Tightly wound?	(smirking) Exactly.
Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.	You mean, like a ham?
No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.	Ok, I get it.
That you remember her.	Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do.
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.	Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...	They are either going to say yes... or no.
Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.	Think it through.
Ryan!	Fumble! Yaaah!
Hey, Dwight.	Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
You all right Ryan?	Ryan.
Pam!	Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
Cugino's pizza.	Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question
That's what she said!	Ha! I don't get it.
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?	Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.	What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, "Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very..."
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.	When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.	I can't do this.
That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.	Oh, okay.
But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.	Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.	I'll try and think of one. When...
Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.	Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?	Saleswoman has a v*g1n*.
It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a s*x Ed class.	But I'm right?
Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!	Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
I do. Both of them.	Could I have a copy of one of them?
Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!	Yeah!
You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.	That is so great about the bonus!
It's unbelievable!	Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Do we know anyone who was in the accident?	Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
Why would this affect our bonuses?	They are unrelated.
Is Brad okay?	He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
Are we out of jobs?	Yes.
Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.	Good morning, Vietnam! Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
No. We're not.	Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
Which means absolutely nothing.	Michael, can you explain?
Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?	I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.	Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.	You did?
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.	Yes. I am.
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.	Which is?
Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own but I wrote up a few talking points for you to take a look at. I hope you don't mind.	I'll glance at it.
The very best of luck to you, Dwight.	Thank you, Angela.
Dwight, how we doing?	No, I can't... I ca...
Good luck. That is a tough crowd.	Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. how long we have been striving for greatness? Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle. A never-ending fight. I say to you and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
nan	WE ARE WARRIORS!
nan	Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
nan	Yeah. Yes!
Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.	No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself.
nan	Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL! We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
Alright.	Ok, thanks. There you are. What happened?
I got thirsty. How'd it go?	It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
You would not believe what happened here.	What? Something happened?
Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.	Weird.
Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'	Con artist.
...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you...	Mmm... hello tiny one.
Mmm... hello tiny one.	And they do, your parents, love you very much.
One more time. You...	You are the future!
You are the future!	The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. They didn't eat the children.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.	There is no way that hurt.
Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.	Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. I don't feel anything. Nothing. You're so weak. Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
Do you have any computer games?	No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here.	You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
Whatever, okay?	You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
That's your name? Mister Poop?	Schrute. Mister Schrute.
Sure, Mister Poop.	... Schrute.
Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.	That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid. This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
Dwight! Dwight!	There's a photo...
What the hell are you reading to them?	These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
What's a Nazi?	Nazi was a fascist movement...
Don't!	...from the 1930's...
Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?	I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Why don't you just leave? Okay?	...Okay.
You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.	We have better service than they do!
That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...	Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
I want to be on TV!	And he is on TV now!
Mister Poop, I have to tell you something.	Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
You're ugly.	Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
Yeah.	Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
Ohh, god.	Birthday hug!
No no no, no, new suit, please.	That suit is amazing.
Thank you very much. It is from Italy. Actually--- no, Bulgaria.	Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
Good luck. One of a kind.	Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.	Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.	Let's get the party started.
One thirty. I'm sorry, are we boring you?	Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
Where do we get those?	Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by.
Michael wants a strippergram?	Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
Stop it. Stop! What is that?	It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.	I probably care more than she does.
If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.	Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents. Unfortunately, this item is on back... order... Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here! Come here!
What?	Listen up everyone! It is 11
Ohhh, God.	There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
Ohhh, no.	So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.	Creed! Come on. Stanley!
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...	On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
Okay.	Happy birth moment, Michael.
Thank you.	One. Two. Three!
Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.	Oscar...
It wasn't me.	Okay, that is not an eight foot sub.
Uh, we don't make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs.	F. Alright, what's the damage?
Uh, thirty-nine sixty.	Thirty nine... sixty.
Thirty nine... sixty.	Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.	Here they come.
Get in here... everybody.	Come and get it!
What is this?	Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
And his favorite lunch.	Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left.
Someone ate three feet of that thing?	Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
Oh. Thank you.	Oh. I got it.
What are--- it's... the party planning committee.	This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
Fine.	What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
Yes... but don't expect any cookie.	But what if i'm hungry?
Are you done? ...Good. Okay.	Here we go. Make a wish.
Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm...	Yaoo yay!
... I asked for trick candles.	Pam was supposed to get 'em.
Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.	Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.	Please, don't.
That should not be there.	I'll get someone to take it down.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.	YEAH!
Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!	Turn it around. Turn it around.
Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.	Number one!!
Michael?	Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
You look cute today, Dwight.	Thanks, girl.
So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight finding drugs is more dangerous than most people using drugs.	Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we? You tell me who this sounds like
Hey...	I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions. But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said "Is it okay if I sip it?" and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.	Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour. Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister! My ass is is on the line! Now I'm going to ask you again. What time did you go home last night?
Six.	I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
I go to a lot of parties.	Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car. Give me you keys.
I am not giving you my keys.	Don't make me do this the hard way.
What's the hard way?	I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.	I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
Whoa. You are a volunteer.	I volunteered for this job.
And that's not the same.	It is my duty...
Volunteer duty.	...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
nan	If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
I wasn't attempting to compliment you.	Well, you have...
Uuf, well...	...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
Okay...	...and I am very proud of being a narc.
I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.	Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.	Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
No, I have not.	Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
What are you implying?	Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
Okay. I'm done with this.	He sure left in a hurry.
He sure left in a hurry.	I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.	Do you know what this is?
Yes, it's marijuana.	How do you know that?
It's labeled.	Dammit.
That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.	No, it's marijuana.
I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.	That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.
Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.	I would remember.
Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?	That's not how it works.
Now how do you know how it works?	Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.
No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?	nan
nan	I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
I understand.	Where were you yesterday after work?
Remember the narc bit? Uh-oh, who's in trouble?	Attention everyone. Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Waa... what? What are you talking about?	Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled. Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.	No you can't do that.
I can do that, it is my office.	No you cannot. It has to be official, and it has to be urine.
Hmmm. Ha. Alright. Great.	Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
I'm not taking Rogaine.	Angela, what about you?
I don't take any prescription drugs.	You're not on anything?
nan	Good.
No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."	Thank you, Michael.
The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.	No, you will be tested.
Yes, I will not be.	You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.	Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
We test a lot of urine.	Mine was green.
Oh, right. How are you?	I'm all better.
So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.	What kind of filing?
Just forget it. Just the urine.	That goes directly to the tester.
Just. I need your urine.	Like in a cup?
Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.	For what purpose?
It's none of your business.	Then I refuse.
Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.	Are you serious?
I need clean urine for the lady.	But that's illegal.
Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes	Not my urine.
A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.	Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
Do you want to give Michael your urine?	I want him to have all the urine he needs.
You're not going to get my permission on this.	I know that. Don't you think I know that?
Yeah. Maybe.	My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.	That's great.
What's wrong? Where's your costume?	It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Why? Wha...	I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.	Really?
Yes, sir.	That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Here's your badge.	Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. Can I have a gun?
No, I don't have a gun.	Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
Good.	Thank you, Michael.
No. Oh. Uh...	I need to go over some details with you.
Alright. Well, Thank you.	First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
Two.	Oh, God.
Okay...	Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Excuse me.	Clown paint.
Clown paint.	I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Are you sure?	Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.	Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.	That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.	Okay, question. When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.	That doesn't make any sense.
Smile.	No.
No.	I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
This came out really well. There you go.	This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
Oh.	And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
What did I write?	I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.	What box?!
Uh. Dwight.	Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Okay! Calm down.	No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Hey, hey!	Him or me?
Stop.	Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Okay...	Either he goes, or I go.
Dwight...	You choose!
Stop...	One of us is out of here by the end of today!
Oh... kay...	I am not bluffing!
Okay.	Okay?
Yes.	Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Mm-hmm.	I deserve this. You know I do!
You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?	You have till five.
You have till five.	Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
Maybe Stanford would be cool.	It's a good market. Higher volume.
Yeah. Maybe we should both go.	I have a girlfriend...
Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.	So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.	I want an answer by tomorrow.
Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?	Fine.
Come on, everybody.	Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?	Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!	I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
Let it ride. Let it all ride.	I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.	Give me the dice!
"Yeah, right," what?	Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
I have good cards.	Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.	How would you do that?
Yeah, I think she's full of it.	You can't be serious. Are you serious?
Oh. Three nines.	I don't believe you. Continue.
Thank you very much. It was fun.	That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.	Oh, my God.
Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.	Come on, shooter!
You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.	Come on. So where you staying? Radisson?
Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.	Super 8?
Again? We do that every year.	Motel 6? Best Western?
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.	Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.	Yes!
Well, then, they need our money more than ever.	Nice, very nice.
Something with animals. Or people.	Oh, man!
Sweet. All right.	Wait, canine AIDS?
Okay, will do.	Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
Bye! Hey.	When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
Oh, well... Kiss. That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight	Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.	I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, "We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them."
I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.	I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
Um...	Hey, hey.
Hey. What...	Jan's here.
Jan's here.	Give me the dice.
Come on, Dwight.	Let's go.
Good evening, Dwight. What is this?	Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
Then roll an eight.	Thank you, Angela.
Are you really gonna marry him? ...Ok.	Jim is gone. He's gone. I miss him so much. Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim! False. I do not miss him.
Can you tell who's gay and who's not?	Of course.
What about Oscar?	Absolutely not.
Well, he is.	Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.	You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
Hey, what about Angela? She's hard and severe. She could be a gay woman.	I really don't think so.
I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?	nan
Do some research. Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.	Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
That's ridiculous.	Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.
Let's call him and get the website.	Definitely.
Well, they're sold out.	Damn. I'll try Brookstone.
Michael, Dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer.	Uh, Michael knows Pam. He asked me to do this just for him. He has his own reasons.
Nothing wrong with this stuff. At all. This is fine. You know what. Gay p0rn, straight p0rn, it's all goooooood! I don't particularly get into this. But uh, you know what. I totally see the merit! And actually... it is quite beautiful.	Ah damn pop-ups.
nan	I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.
No one else in this office is gay.	What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.	Michael appears to be gay too. And yet he is my friend. I guess I do have a gay friend.
I was going to quit. But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car. All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue. Gill and I are going to Europe. Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay.	"Hope this helps. -Jim" Nice!
What are you doing?!	Shhh. Don't be scared. It works. ...oh no.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.	Don't be mad, it is a business trip.
Yeah.	Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager.
I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.	Yes, Monkey.
Some people need dozens of friends to say, "Hey, look at me, I'm popular." But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.	And your veil.
Yeah, do it!	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Really? Okay. Well, word of advice	Blood, urine, or semen.
Um. Okay, um.	Um.
You got that?	I got it.
Write it down.	I got it.
I got it.	Um.
Andrea's the office bitch. You'll get used to her. Creed.	Can I have my neck pillow back? Michael! Can I have my neck pillow back?
Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!	Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
Hey!	Shut up. That's impossible.
No, it's not. I did. Yep.	Well, I did it too.
If I weren't engaged, I would so hit that.	So what kind of commissions you get up there?
Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.	You're so immature!
Oh, hey!	Hey, Jan.
And they're, like, so smart. I don't even know what they mean half the time.	This party is going to be awesome.
I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.	Check it out.
That is crooked on that side.	Wow.
All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.	I'll do a shot, Michael.
Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.	Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.
All right.	I'm a huge fan.
So maybe. See ya.	Why do they call him The Bus?
Because he's afraid to fly.	Smile!
Yep. Yeah, she's up front.	You don't have email on your phone.
I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?	No one just called you.
I need you to do something for me.	Yes. Anything.
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.	I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
Okay.	So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.
And?	He wasn't volunteering today.
Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.	Whoa. Michael.
You're welcome.	Was that your per diem?
Michael.	Hey, Michael.
Okay! Excellent. Oh...	Keep the wing flaps.
You first.	Come on. Nice try, Josh!
Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.	Yes! Ha!
Movie Monday! The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!	Don't fire me. Please.
Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!	Take a seat down there. Second from the end.
Take a seat down there. Second from the end.	I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
Popcorn anyone?	I'll do anything! Anything! I'll do your laundry for a month! For a year!
Anyone else? Nooo.	I'm sorry! I'll do anything, I swear.
Entourage!	You can't. You can't. But I promise I'll never betray you again. What can I do, Michael. What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? What can I do?
Hug it out, bitch. That is what men say to each other, after a fight. They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go. And walk away. And they're done. Not a good idea to say that to a woman however. I have found. It doesn't translate.	Why him?
Hello?	Not everyone approves of Movie Monday. I won't say who.
Michael is going to get us all fired. You sat back and let him play that dumb movie, and now Jan is peeved off and we're all going to lose our jobs.	That's not going to happen.
You know she has it out for him now.	That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!
That's not his fault! He had to follow his heart!	Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him. Reject a woman and she will never let it go. One of the many defects of their kind. Also weak arms.
Dwight, you should be running this office.	Michael would never let me...
It's not up to Michael, it's Jan's call. Talk to her.	I could never do that!
Yeah.	WAH! GAH!
Hello?	Is this Jan?
Who is this?	This is Dwight Schrute. I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
You should talk to Michael, and he'll talk to me, and that way we don't have to speak to each other.	It's about Michael.
What about him?	I can't talk here. It's too sensitive.
It's not about a surprise party is it?	No, but we should discuss that another time.
Look, I am already an hour outside of Scranton, Dwight, I'm not coming back.	Pull over at exit 40. There is a Liz Claiborne outlet. I know you like that store. Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
How do you know I like that store?	Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
How do you know that?	Part of my job.
No it's not. It's officially not.	...noted.
...noted.	I'm going... to the dentist.
Ok.	I have to have an emergency crown put in.
Ouchy.	Yes. It's a new dentist. He's far. I might be gone... three hours.
Three hours, wow. Have fun.	Did you get anything good?
Yeah.	New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy?
New blouse? Halter top? Camisole? Teddy?	I can save the branch.
Really?	If you let me run it.
Ok.	"Ok" I can run it?
What would you do differently?	Mostly get rid of waste. Which is half the people there. And clean house. Right here. It's all for me. Thank you.
Dwight, you must feel strongly, to speak with me this way, behind Michael's back, and turn on so many of your co-workers.	The decision to turn on Michael was difficult. But once I did it, I didn't look back. And mostly I feel that Michael would approve. It's really what's best for the branch. And I could care less about my co-workers. So, here we are. It's all, on the table. I want... the branch. And I await your decision.

I know you like their earrings.
Hey Dwight.	Hey.
Do you want an M&M?	No thanks I'm stuffed.
No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good.	...ok.
They're good, huh?	...so good.
Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.	They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
Sounds like a good dentist.	Oh, yeah.
What's his name?	Crentist.
Your dentist's name is Crentist.	Yep.
Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.	Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
Let me see your teeth. Let me see 'em. Let me see 'em.	Ahh. Aaaah.
You should... floss.	I know...
Wow, this is tough.	What?
Ohhhh. Arrrgggh!	What is it?
Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me.	No.
Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!	Gahh!
And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.	I can't believe this news. That--- wow.
I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.	You said that?
Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it.	Well... Gosh, if you think I should. Then I will.
Perfect, well, we're settled.	All right.
All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.	Assistant to the regional manager. Thank you Michael, for staying on. I really appreciate it.
Ohh..	Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.	Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. Ok let's do it.
Congratulations Dwight.	Thank you Angela.
Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?	Thank you Michael. I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black! With ferocity!
It's really happening!	Yes.
We can make a difference here.	I, will, make a difference here.
You alone? Because I thought together we could---	Oh please, don't be naive. But you can be in charge of the women.
Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.	No thank you.
It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.	No thanks.
What?	Not my style.
But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.	Well that was before. I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage. Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
Take it back.	No.
That's my car.	What did you---
THAT'S MY CAR.	Yes.
I know, Dwight. I know. I know. I know.	You know what?
Jan called me about your little meeting!	No!
I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight.	I think the Sebring's cool. It's cool. The Seabring's cool. It has a cassette and it has a CD.
All right, I'll be right back.	Whoo!
There you go.	Awesome!
You're welcome.	Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute.	Okay. Whoo!
What?	Really?
Oh my God.	That is the way to go. Instant death. Very smart.
You know a human can go on living for several hours after being decapitated.	You're thinking of a chicken.
So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...	Ed was decapitated.
What are you doing?	You said you didn't know how to say it.
I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.	Hey.
Hi.	If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
I do not wanna talk about this.	When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it. I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.
We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...	That is not a statue, that is a robot.
I think that is a great way to honor Ed.	And how big do you want this robot?
Life-size.	Mm, no. Better make it two-thirds. Easier to stop if it turns on us.
DEAD.	Look I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?	I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.
Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING!	Michael! Michael. Michael ...
Oh, God!	Oh...
Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ...	Poor little fella.
Oh shhhh--oot!	He is a goner.
No, he's not.	Yeah.
No, he's not.	Michael, get him away from your head! He is covered in germs and bacteria!
Ugh, no that thing is dead.	You want me to flush him?
I mean, how many times to I have to confirm with Ryan for him to know that we have a date tonight?	Argh... gah!
What are... What are you doing?	What? No, this is about the right size.
No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?	I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. It would have fit if he had given me another minute.
I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm. We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon. My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. It would have fit if he had given me another minute.	I need a box. I need a box. A small box... not too confining.
Is it for the bird?	Yeah.
I have it covered.	Oh, thank you.
If you wanna do something for the funeral...	Yes, please.
Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.	Excellent.
Do you have it with you?	Always.
And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.	He's not a songbird.
Amen.	nan
Society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.	Let's get back to work.
Let's get back to work.	Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?
Yes! How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen?	No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
Pam?	Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...
Pam?	A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
Oh, yeah, I should, I should, I should probably go too.	A hunter.
Oh, no no.	Damn it!
It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.	So you excited?
Yeah.	Very excited?
Yes. I'm very excited.	Extremely excited? ... Just very? That's cool.
I have spent a year here. I have to commit or get out. Dwight's the top salesman in the company and he's taking me on my first sales call today. And, um, I'm excited.	I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?
So what if they're not talking much, then does it makes sense to kind of lead the conversation? You know, just 'till it gets to a point where they are asking questions? So where's the sales office?	When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.	Do you know where we are, temp?
I know where we're not.	I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. AH! When... Damn it.
Oh, shhh... Come on.	And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.
I don't think you know what you're saying.	Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?
Uh huh.	It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.
Gotcha.	Oh hey, I forgot something in my car. I'll be right back.
Hey Dwight, you're a great salesman. Can you teach me? Sure, Ryan. I'll make you the ole commodor. I'll abandon you in a beet field. Huh. That sounds great, Dwight, I'll really appreciate that. Thank you so much for your mentorship.	Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.
Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.	It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.
Look man, I was in a frat in college. So I know what you're doing. I get it.	You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?
Yeah.	Come on!
All right! Thank you!	Please be seated.
Who was that?	Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.
Is that your Cousin Mose?	Yes.
Yes.	Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.
Mose is my cousin and he lives here. He will always be my best friend. Unless things go well with Ryan today in which case, I won't hang out with Mose so much anymore.	What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?
Outsourcing and consolidation of competition.	Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
Depression?	Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
You're a freak!	Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?
Um, loneliness. Maybe women.	Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.
No. Ok. All right. All right. It's over. This is over. OK.	Wrestle him to the ground.
No, you're a freak. I'm not doing this anymore. This is over. Goodbye.	Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?
Bye, Ryan. He seemed nice.	Where are all the animals?
Where are all the animals?	Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.
Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.	You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.
Look, that, that's not what I wanted, ok. I just wanted to go on a sales call.	Screwgun. The sales call!
Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?	Establish time frames. Keep the phrase "real dollars" in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.
Wait, can you go back?	Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Ok, I'm going to establish time frames.	Good.
I'm going to put everything in terms of "real dollars".	Right.
I'm going to ask a lot of questions that all have sort of positive answers.	Uh huh.
Saying, that would be better, or we would like that. That sort of thing.	Exactly. Yes.
They really didn't like me.	They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.
I don't get it. I don't get what I did wrong.	Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh, hi Jan. He's, uh, on a sales call. No message? Bye, Jan.	Temp! Temp! Temp! Temp! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Yes! Just think, that temp agency could have sent you anywhere.
I just feel kind of tired, you know.	Maybe you've got mono.
Well, go with Dwight. He's single, too. Right?	Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
She looks like Pam from the neck down.	Pam wishes. Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...
Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world. Here are some famous Indians. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '	I see dead people.
Okay. Spoiler... alert.	He was dead the whole time.
I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?	Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!
Hey.	Oh my God!
Who are you faxing so early in the morning?	nan
I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. "Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight."	We did it!
We did it!	No! You'll thank me later.
Michael.	In your face!
Michael.	Oh, man.
I am here to tell you that we are closing the Scranton branch.	I don't ... have no idea.
Pictures. Memories. Look at that. They grow up so fast.	Hey stranger.
Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.	Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. Let's go.	Yes!
Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.	What's the plan?
Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.	Can I drive?
No... way.	Shotgun!
No. There's no one else.	Still.
Still.	Thank you very much. Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.
Okay, okay. Um...	But, do not worry. I have his home address right here.
Why?	Christmas card list.
You sent him cards? You never met him.	But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.	So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?
I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.	No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
All right.	Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.
Excuse me, Mr. Wallace? David Wallace?	Yes? What is the meaning of this?
Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?	Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.	Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity
Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.	Whoa hey, why not?
Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?	Okay.
Don't touch me this time.	Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?	Uh!
No.	Ah. Here, replinish your fluids.
Uh, we don't know. Probably. A few.	who is it?
The office.	Gonna get it?
Anything?	Nothing.
What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?	Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.	My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
That was hilarious. The foam ...	Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.	What were your favorite moments?
Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.	What about when Jan said the branch was closing?
God, Dwight!	Well, it doesn't...
What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.	nan
That's the other thing you got to watch out... Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.	Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Oh. You've changed so much.	Psh, why is that great?
So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?	What was your mile time?
Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.	I could beat that on a skateboard.
Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...	Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
All right.	Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
Okay.	I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.
All right. I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.	Man, what is taking Toby so long?
All right!	And you'll compare the times?
Take a picture. It'll last longer.	No, my groin...
Ditto that, my brother.	...is really tight.
What is that? A squid's eye or...	I can't...
How did you...	Aaaaah!
What smell?	Nametag?
Oh, I'll help you find it.	Karen Filippelli.
What is it?	Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
Bob Vance bought this perfume for me in Metropolitan Orlando. It's made from real pine.	That's Andy Bernard.
You have a lot to learn about this town, sweetie.	If I were you...
People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences? A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.	...I would fire Anthony Gardner...
What?	Do you have batteries?
Do you have batteries?	...before noon...
nan	...to consolidate power.
What is love?	No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
Yes, yes! Okay!	The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.
Whoa-oh-oh-oh	Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Michael, I didn't get a gift bag.	Very funny, Michael!
My bag's mostly pencils.	Really funny, Michael!
Uh wait, are you a robot or a Martian?	Do this. Come on. Ready?
I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.	On three. One... two... three.
Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. Not... so, your desk is...	Hey, hey. Easy.
I was on the fence about this and... it's just not a good fit.	Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.
I can't work here. I have to quit.	Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
No. Toby was helpful. He was very kind. It's just your management style.	What are you doing?
No. Was it supposed to be funny?	I have a smudge on my forehead?
Excuse me?	Why are you looking at my forehead?
But there's nothing in my desk except coupons.	Meet my eye line, Jim!
I am.	That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.	Stop acting like an idiot!
Okay.	And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
Cool, thank you.	What!
Hey, this came with the Stamford book. [Sets down box that says	YEAH!
Hey! Why doesn't your car have a flat tire?	Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
For crying out loud.	So you'll be reporting to me, then.
What's up with this guy?	My title has 'Manager' in it.
THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!	Oh.
Is he always like this?	I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
This thing is so awesome. It will shred anything. Ooh! It will shred a CD. It will shred... a credit card. It will shred... oh! Shoot.	If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.
Yeah, it does, actually.	We need to talk!
We need to talk!	So who will be your new Number Three?
Uh... that I have not decided yet.	Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?
Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.	Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?	And I have to say your leadership...
Shut it...	Ok. Who reports to who?
Ok. Who reports to who?	has brought...
Shut it! That's... suck up!	And then if I want...
I'm at the grocery store buying a corkscrew to give myself a lobotomy.	I...
Oh my god! Hey! You want to meet at Cooper's in an hour? I need a drink.	I...
Yeah.	One...
Um... You might want these orientation materials.	Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
Oh, this looks promising.	Xterra's not even a real word.
Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".	Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.	That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.	Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
So check out how we live	Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
They call it Scranton.	Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.	What?
The Electric City. Scranton.	Idiot!
Idiot!	What?
The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.	If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.	But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.	You're the idiot!
nan	I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. Totally got the best of that interchange.
You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,	But the little cars go in the compact spot
Just... try to be cool.	I am cool.
Okay, are you cool, really?	I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.
Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!	I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.	Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...	Merry Christmas!
Merry Christ-- NO! Why... why did you bring that here?	It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael?
It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael?	Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.
No.	I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!
I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!	Who are you calling?
I'm just gonna call her.	Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?
What can I get for 'ya?	Jim.
One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.	What does it look like?
That's a great idea.	And circle gets the square.
I was just getting a snack.	So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.
Pam, don't tell her what to do! Phyllis.	No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
OK.	Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.
I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.	He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.
So I only use three?	Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
OK. Are you sure I can't use like, the cartoons from the newspaper?	Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.
Hey. All right, I'll see you guys later.	It's Christmas Toby.
He's cute. You should date him.	Toby...
I'm sorry.	Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.
Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.	Please? Please?
Clean it in your car.	Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.
Actually, the Usuba's the better knife when you're working with this quantity.	Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.
Oh Pam. Take a chill pill.	Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.
No.	Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!
Yes? Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.	Start the party.
I don't back down. My sister and I used to be best friends, and we haven't talked in 16 years. Over some disagreement, I don't even remember. So... yeah. I'm pretty good.	Oh, ouch. Michael, I don't think there is anything wrong with the way you described her.
Right.	Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?
Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...	Oh... Narcolepsy.
I don't understand?	Oh my gosh, now she's up.
I think you're a really sweet guy.	Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
That rocks.	Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?
Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.	Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.	Hey! It's Angela! Hey!
We're going to ...	Copy.
It would never work here.	No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything.
A Christmas drinking game ...	No... way! Yeah!
God help you.	Oh.
These are all terrible ideas and none of them are on the theme of "A Nutcracker Christmas." I think you should leave.	Walkie-talkies.
You tried this out, and it's clearly not for you. It's time to go. Come on. Please. Thank you. OK, thank you very much.	Yes!
Well the Committee to Plan Parties has served its purpose. We're gonna disband. In the name of Christmas.	We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
I'm not sure. Does your karaoke machine have Christmas songs?	Oh, look at this. Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box.
Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.	Why don't you just buy the whole song?
Mmm. Hmm.	Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.
Two hundred dollars.	Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?
I... We're just gonna take off.	Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.
No... I have school.	As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
Merry Christmas.	You're number four.
You're number four.	Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...
That waitress was the one.	Ah, no. You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth.
How can you be sure?	Ok, good
Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.	OK, this is stupid.
I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.	No no, no, wait, wait, wait Permission to join the Validity Committee.
I, I put a mark on her arm. So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!	Damn it!
Thanks.	pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
C'mon Jim, let's go.	Bye Pam.
Oh no, that would be great.	Get out Jim. Actually, um... Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.
Yes.	What the? "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone." Destroy phone?
What the? "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone." Destroy phone?	I can't... I can't here what you're saying.
Carol used to drink lattes.	What're you talking about?
She would get this little foam mustache...	Carol had a mustache?
And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny.	What are you guys talking about?
She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---	Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... what is this?	Tape recorder.
For what?	For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?	What?
You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.	I'm not.
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!	I do not have a knife!
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!	Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.	Give me it. I am not.
Oh, Jim Carrey just walked in! Dwight, get his autograph for Michael quickly...	Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.	You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
I have a special assignment for you.	Who's the target?
A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."	What's it of?
Not important.	Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.
OK, forget it.	OK, I accept it.
She bought it? OK. OK.	Michael hit a deer?
Michael hit a deer?	Michael! Michael! There's an emergency in the warehouse.
There an accident? Somebody hurt?	No, it's... involves the photograph.
Definitely.	I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.
There are copies in the bathroom?	There were. A lot of them.
Oh, yes! Yes! What'd I tell you? I knew he'd turn up You see that? This is the greatest night of my life.	Who did this to you? Where is he?
What? No, it's not... it's nothing.	It's hot in here.
Yeah.	Yeah.
Thanks. You don't need to stay here.	I know. So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
Hi, Jim.	That's what she said.
I am Harvey, a computer. Jim sucks.	It's going to be ok.
Yeah, you can.	That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.
For this?	Well, I don't have a lot of choices.
Damn it.	Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?	I would like to give the rest of my belongings to Michael Scott. Just take them. Except this.
You ruined a funny joke, you. Get out of my offive.	One of my life goals was to die right here in my desk chair. And today, that dream was shattered.
Everything ok?	Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.	Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?
Dwight?	Yup?
Here ya go.	Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.	Come on!!
Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?	Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
Mind? Nothing would delight me more.	Leave the keys.
You still do that thing?	Leave the keys!
After you sir.	No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.
Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.	Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with...
'Kay. 'Kay.	Can I use your phone?
Yeah, sure, go ahead.	Thanks.
Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.	One...
We have discount prices on ink cartridges...	Three...
And, also, any forms that you are going to need...	Seven...
We'll I appreciate what you guys are saying but it, uh, makes more fiscal sense to go with one of the big guys.	Sure.
Please keep holding, your call is very important to us.	Erm, that's one of the 'Big guys.' Been on hold this whole time.
Oh my god, Jim. How are you ? I wanted to tell you ... .	Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays.
Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.	I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.
Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.	My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.
We should go on a double date.	No thank you.
Big deal.	Hey, we nailed the sale!
Where were you this morning?	I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.
Why do you lie, liar?	I am not a liar.
It sure seems like he is lying.	Stay out of this, you!
I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.	Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.
Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.	I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.
I have left Dunder-Mifflin after many record-breaking years and am officially on the job market. And it's very exciting.	For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts
For your convenience, I've broken it down into three parts	I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.
I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me.	How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.
How would I describe myself? Three words. Hard-working, Alpha male, Jackhammer, Merciless, Insatiable.	There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.
There is nothing on my horizon except everything. Everything is on my horizon.	I got this job to make some money while I continue my employment search. And uh, it's fine for the time being. Oops. Break's over.
You sell those two printers this morning? Nice work.	Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.	Need any help?
Oh, no, thank you. I'm just looking.	Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
Really comin' down out there. Commute's gonna be hell.	I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
So um, where were you workin' before this?	Dunder-Mifflin.
What kind of company is that?	Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area.
I never heard of 'em.	Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
Sure? Okay.	Well, that question is meaningless. Just go with the copy paper. It's your funeral. See how that works out for you.
Hey.	Hey.
What's up?	Same old.
Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.	Oh my God, she told you?
Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.	Accepted.
How's this place treating you?	The boss isn't funny.
Oh, well.	I don't get to wear my ties.
No. I'm sure.	So?
So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.	I don't want to do your laundry anymore.
Welcome back.	Thank you.
Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it. Not bad, huh?	You did this for me?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the big finale! Sir, would you do the honor?	Oh, man. No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out!
Oh my God, I would get so fat if I worked here.	How do you know it's going to be a boy?
I'm closer to firing you.	nan
No. No.	Are you near sighted or far sighted?
You just twist your hand until something breaks.	GAH!!!
GAH!!!	Ow.
And remember no matter what, I will always love you.	What if he's a murderer?
He's not going to be a murderer.	Maybe that's how you die.
You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?	I want to do this.
Okay. From the top. Ready? Three-	Action.
Okay everybody, slight change of plans, we are still going to be having two parties but each is going to get a little extra dose of naught-ay. Uh!	Alright! Uh!
Gay.	What?
Absolutely not.	I'm on it.
Well get on it. And make it happen.	Ruddy cheeks, thick calves, no tats, no moles, no tats. No, TATS. Of course I want-
Stop. That's disgusting.	Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
Fine.	I knew you would, Nancy.
Sally.	No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
Blonde.	Nice. Do you have any blonde women?
Have you ever seen a stripper before?	Yes. Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias. It was one of her many aliases.
I'm Elizabeth, I'm the dancer that was requested.	Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
I'm the stripper.	Oh, okay good. Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
Oh God.	Is she hot? Text back, "Kind of."
Guys, beef! It's what's for dinner! Who wants some man meat?	I do! I want some man meat!
Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work!	Elizabeth, I want you to sit here. When the phone rings, answer it.
You want me to answer phones with my clothes on.	We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
Wow. Thank you.	Care for a piece of chocolate?
Chocolate! Where did you acquire it? That is a delicacy in the Amazon but it has not yet been imported to the United States.	Who is the king of Austria?
Joseph the 2nd.	Who is the king of Prussia?
Fredrick Wilhelm the 3rd.	Who is the king of England?
Why the tyrant King George, of course!	I don't care what Jim says, that is not the real Ben Franklin. I am 99% sure.
Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?	What do you think?
Dwight, want an Altoid?	Okay.
Altoid?	Sure
Mint Dwight?	Inbwit? Yes.
Inbwit? Yes.	nan
What are you doing?	I...
What?	I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.
Unbelievable.	Hello, Angela.
Hi, Dwight.	You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
Thank you. Don't linger. Break left. Left!	The Shrutes have their own traditions. We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.
Long story short	Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.	No way.
Did you ever see that movie?	Of course I saw it.
Of course I saw it.	I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.
You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.	Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
That's ok.	It's a miracle.
Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.	Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.
I don't have that, Dwight.	Dammit, Phyllis!
Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks	'Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?
Who?	The bride and groom? What are their names?
Oh, I... I don't... I'm not sure.	Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.
Okay, Okay. Where are we going?	Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.
Come... Come on!	I can't let you in, Michael.
Dwight, just...	No, it's Bob and Phyllis' orders.
Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.	You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?	"Don't be an idiot." Changed my life.
"Don't be an idiot." Changed my life.	Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, "Would an idiot do that?" And if they would, I do not do that thing.
....Dude.	...Oh my God. Animal stool.
Dwight, what are you doing?	Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
Oh my God!	BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.	We have... a bat... in the office.
Okay. Thanks. Animal control will be here at six.	At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...	What? What's so wierd?
Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business	This is your job, Halpert.
What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.	No... no. One crisis at a time.
No... no. One crisis at a time.	If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a "sylvania." Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.	I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.	Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
Sure.	--to use sudden violence.
Okay.	Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!	Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?	Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.	Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
Goodbye Jim. And good luck.	Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?	Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh!
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!	Hold still, woman!
Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!	... ... You're welcome.
Ok.	Yes. But this seems to be...
Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.	I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?	The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.	nan
No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!	It's early bird gets the worm.
This is over.	Let me smell. Good, not great.
Whatever.	Thanks for inviting me along.
I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...	Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.	Hello, Jan.
Ok.	Talk to you later, Jan.
Beauty. Thank you sir!	Salad.
Thank you.	You dressed exactly like the servants.
Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.	Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.	That would have been really embarrassing.
Yes.	Crisis averted.
Oh, um, potato salad.	It's from both of us.
No thank you, Roy.	Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.	Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
No.	No? Then you are an idiot.
Thank you.	What's the square footage?
About 5,000.	Does that include the garage?
Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.	I'm just...
I don't know	It's a common question.
David, how much did this house cost?	These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
I'll show you around.	Cool, let's start with the banisters.
I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.	Huh. Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here?.
Uh, that's a guest room.	Just the one window?
Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me.	Are those real pearls?
Uh, yes.	Good.
Yes.	Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
I don't know, it was here when I was born.	I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
I don't know.	What do you know?
Thank you.	Pam, please call security!
Well...	Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees. And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now?
I don't know.	Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted. I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
Jim--- Roy--- Look out!	Don't want it.
Thank you, Hunter. Hello. Come in. Ah, Okay.	Don't want it. Won't open it. Don't need it. Won't take it. Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
That's my new assistant.	No, don't call me a hero. Do you know who the real heroes are? The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime. Those are the real heroes.
Okay.	What's this?
And what happens in this one?	Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department. "Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man. Dwight K. Schrute"
Okay.	Please. They hand these out to little kids. Look. There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---	I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed. His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position. Perp grabbed the victim. I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---	Irrelevant. Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area. Rendering him utterly and completely disabled. Then I contacted the authorities. The end.
You know what? I didn't---	Really?
...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan. I'm not.	Mm, good stuff.
Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...	Sounds... fun.
Yeah.	No need to thank me.
You ready for me?	I am not a hero. I am a mere defender of the office. You know who's a real hero? Hiro, from Heroes. That's a hero. Also, Bono.
Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.	When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
Boy I---	No. And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
Oh. Drew. Sorry.	Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back. And I've got a new attitude. And a new name. And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.	Michael! What's wrong?
Hey, Andy. How are you, man?	Depressed? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.	Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years. Which I'm looking forward to. It's an Amish technique. It's like slapping someone with silence. I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
Oh my God, there is a castle.	Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.	No, there's nothing to see over there, people! There's nothing to see. ...They found the castle, Michael.
Damn it.	Ok, tell him that's not true.
Yeah...	Ok, no. Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run. Jim! Tell him!
Hey Michael! I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.	Damn you.
Hmm.	Okay, uh... I don't see anything. She might be bluffing.
No! No no no no no! I said should you. You should not drive it. You should not drive the forklift, you understand?	Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.	Yeah!
They use props. They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.	Idiots! God, what are we gonna do!?
I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression---	Wolves.
Nn--- Depression.	Visual aids.
Yes.	A quilt. Depression quilt?
Ryan, well done. Two minutes, forty-two seconds. Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said "awesome" 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.	Okay, let's do this thing! I'll go summon the troops!
Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or...	We measured it once...
Go buy some watermelons.	Seedless?
I don't know this place as well as I thought I did. I'm getting cleaned out.	Ready?
Let's do it! Drop that sucker.	nan
BINGO! WHOA WHOA WHOA! Oh... crap. Deactivate the car alarm. Clean up the mess.	Okay.
Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.	Got it.
Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.	We're not allowed to use the baler.
Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.	I'm on it!
I'm on it!	I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
Thank you.	It means nothing. I need you to do something for me.
Anything.	Okay, calm down. I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
You mean a moon bounce.	What do you think? You've got an hour.
I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.	Shunning resumed.
Do you, do you want a drawbridge?	Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun.
Un-shun. Yeah that sounds good. Re-shun.	Oh yeah, this is much better. Safer. Excellent decision.
Yes, thank you for seeing that.	When you land, try and land like an eight year-old. These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
I don't know if I wanna do this.	Do you wanna do another test? I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking.	That's right! Doing! Totally doing! It's rock n' roll!
Rock n' roll!	Yeah!
That's right! I am not thinking.	Near near near near near!
Yes! Yeah!	Michael is awesome! Jumpin' off the roof!
Woo!	Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce! Show 'em who's boss!
Woo!	Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point!	Guys! Listen up! Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
Whoa! What's the situation?	Un-shun. I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?	Un-shun. Never. Re-shun. I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
Is it nice outside?	It's gorgeous. Let's go!
Do I need my jacket?	No really, it's, it's very nice. Come on!
Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?	Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go!
Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go! Let's go!	Come on, hurry up you guys!
My life! Oh, my life...	Michael, what's wrong?!
Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.	Depression? Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!	Is that the last year the data was available?
Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!	Don't do anything rash!
Wait, where are the warehouse guys?	I didn't... I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Okay... that's...	you said to just...
That's the whole point, dummy.	Okay, I'm on it!
Okay.	Attention blue collar workers!
It's kind of blurry. That's better. Question. What kind of bear is best?	Pam.
Pam.	That's a ridiculous question.
False. Black bear.	Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
Pssssh. I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.	Well that's debatable. There are basically two schools of thought---
Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.	Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert. Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?	Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
No.	You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!
I'm good. Thanks.	Oh, that's funny. MICHAEL!
Yes, I understand. Can I transfer you to customer relations?	I'm Jim Halpert.
I know, I know. We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.	Ah-luh-luh, a little comment. Muh.
Everybody in here. STAT. No time to lose. Cri-Man-Squa. F and C, doubletime.	Cri-Man-Squa?
No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.	Yes! You are entering the "No Spin Zone!"
No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves.	Not!
OK, press conference in 45. Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.	On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair.
On it. OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage. Pam, run a comb through your hair.	First rule in road-side beet sales
First rule in road-side beet sales	Hey! Look sharp! Hey! Uh, Hi. Hello, Dwight Schrute.
Hi, uh---	And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Scranton Times. Chad Lite, "Lighter Side of Life."	And "Breaking Corporate News."
And obits.	Oh, dear God. OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance.
Oh...	Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way. Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly. Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---	Great.
When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.	Emergency dentist appointment.
And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident. And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.	You look good in this.
I don't care! It was disgusting. Cartoon characters having s*x?	May I point out that the s*x appeared to be consensual? Both animals were smiling.
OK...	I grew up on a farm. I have seen animals having s*x in every position imaginable. Goat on chicken. Chicken on goat. Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching. Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
Mm-hmm.	It's non-transferable...
"Hello. I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner. Let me tell you something. Something from the heart. I am not leaving this office. It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that."	Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
That's how devoted I am to this job.	I'm just saying...
I know.	They would flank you. Throw in a concussion grenade.
I understand that, Dwight.	You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?	Cut.
I don't think we really need that, Michael.	That is a demerit.
You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. Coming!	You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?	Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.	Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Lay it on me.	No. Wholesies.
No. Wholesies.	Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
Now that sounds serious.	Natch.
Natch.	Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Which would be me.	You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass.
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass.	That is correct.
Good luck, Michael.	What's a dis... what's that?
Thank you.	Move!
If that's flashing, then lock me up.	Dunder-Mifflin paper/s*x predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
Yeah.	Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.
Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.	Ugh. I'm hanging up.
Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.	You have information about the s*x predator?
What is so funny?	Where?
I'm guessing not.	Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. PAM!
You got it, Jan.	Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.	Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
OK.	There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.	Look at that one.
Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.	Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his pen1s - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?	Answer
Phallus?	Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? "Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute." This is ridiculous.	Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.	Desperate times call for desperate measures.
See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?	Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?	Mm, less than three.
That is not current.	You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.	Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a pen1s, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.	Alien. Blagh!
I have to know whether you're serious or not.	I wish I could menstruate.
I wish I could menstruate.	If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. Let's go!	Have you finished with the sketch?
Yeah.	Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
Uh, Phyllis got a good look.	Hmm.
Hmm.	I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.	Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
This guy looks like a real deviant.	No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
Aye, aye, Cap'n.	More like, "Aye, aye, General."
Many women are competent drivers. OK. Come on.	This is what we know.
One. Two. Three! Go! Do it! Go, Michael.	OK, where does it hurt?
On the go that's after three.	No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
One, two, three, go!	"Abdomen. Menses."
"Abdomen. Menses."	No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
Don't, don't.	"The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it."
"The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it."	I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.	GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB!
GIVE ME THE JOB! GIVE ME THE JOB!	Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
That's possible.	Aaagh, aaagh!
David Wallace is on line one.	Aggggh, that stings!
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.	The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, "Describe your act." And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, "What do you call yourselves?" And the man says, "The Aristocrats!"
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.	I mean truly repulsive acts.
Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!	Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.	I hope there will be management parables.
Just words. Inspiring words. Not a contender. For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.	Yes!
Jim Halpert. Pros	I choose Michael!
I'm not playing.	OK, temp.
We are going to choose team names. Dwight?	We will be called Gryffindor.
Really? Not Slytherin?	Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.	He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ... Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!	OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
Yup. Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.	Come on! Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.	What are you saying?
You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.	OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.	I am trying to bring team spirit.
Pam...you're missing things.	Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you b*st*rd! What the? Damn it temp!
Turkey is a healthy meat.	It's very good for you.
The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?	You're leaving?
13 hot dogs, everybody!	Damn it!
Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!	Sabotage.
What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?	No. I was saying that before. Not now. Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
I knew you were saying sabotage. I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.	If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway. I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.	Gaaaaa....
One. Two. Three.	Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Excellent!	Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.	That's not why you lost.
Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.	Yeah, right.
Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon!	Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
What's different about you? You look worse.	Who's ready to work?
After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from. For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so thank you.	Michael is gone.
Hail to the chief!	You wanted to see me?
You wanted to see me?	My first order of business
My first order of business	But that's my name. Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch. Thank you.
But that's my name. Dwight, congratuations a-wipe. Don't screw the pooch. Thank you.	As if you had a choice. Duh. Opportunity of a lifetime.
Three months ago, I was nowhere. I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management. Look where I am now. Not bad.	Thank you, Michael.
Uh, administrative assistant.	Thank you so much.
I think she's comin' in... later.	Thank you.
It's okay, we all say things without thinking.	You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk. Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
Oh. Okay.	I had to make Andy my number two. It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand. I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.	Well, in a sense. Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.	Correct, I need someone I can trust. But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you. Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
nan	Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.
No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...	Do you accept?
Yeah.	Listen up! Come to the center of the room, please. This... is a Schrute Buck. When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck. One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
Will do.	Excellent question, Pam. 1/100th of a cent.
Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you. I really miss our friendship.	Just... zip your lid! Another announcement. Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness. No longer. No more meetings!
I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.	Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
nan	Yes! Michael is gone. There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is "me." Conference room! Ten seconds! All of you!
Wha? Who gave you that advice?	Listen up. Let's start... from the ground up. Where does paper come from?
I have to buy another place.	Trees! And where do trees grow?
You're not sure that you have the job.	Soil. Right. We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil. Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth? Probably phosphorus, right? Wrong! It's nitrogen! Absorb this information. Good! Now, let us discuss precipitation. Stanley! When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
Liquid.	How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?	Very good! You have earned one Schrute Buck.
I don't want it.	No, no, not Michael. Me. I'm taking his job.
No, no, not Michael. Me. I'm taking his job.	Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
Make it 100.	Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Jim, Jim, Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.	We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
No. In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.	I am gonna be your new boss. It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.
I am gonna be your new boss. It's my greatest dream come true. Welcome to the Hotel Hell. Check in time is now. Check out time is never.	What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.	No. And the sheets are made of fire.
No. And the sheets are made of fire.	Okay---
That's it!	Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.	What---
Class is canceled, everybody out!	I'll have to talk to the manager.
I'll have to talk to the manager.	No wait, what are you doing?!
I'm punishing them.	I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan!
I'm the owner. The co-owner. With Satan!	No, no, no, wait! Class is not canceled.
nan	Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
What--- What are you winking for?	Eighty thousand dollars a year.
Eighty thousand dollars a year.	Zip your lid!
Zip your lid!	Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two. My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Okay. Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...	Yes you will.
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.	It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black.
Ohh...	It's so intimidating! Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...	To intimidate my subordinates.
No. No, no, no, no. I'll tell you this, it is not because of the boob job. Excuse me, boob enhancement. That would be shallow. And this is the opposite of shallow. This is... emotionally magnificent.	It was Andy's idea.
It was Andy's idea.	Okay, everyone, listen up! Time to begin the interview process! Andrew Bernard.
No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids.	No! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do not wish them luck. Do not wish them luck. All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Did... Karen get the job?	What did I say!?
Good luck.	Pam, hello.
I'm happy for him. I hope he gets the job. I really just want him to be happy. And I know that sounds cliche. And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche... Maybe I'm being cliche. I don't care. Cause I am what I am. That's Popeye.	I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity.
I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager. You served the office with great dignity.	I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity. What is the best color?
I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.	Wrong. Black. It is the most dominant. How do you make a table?
Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim. You're clearly a very bright guy.	What is the capital of Maine?
Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---	Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk. Don't wanna hear about it. Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?	You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
Oh, no, absolutely.	Time! No, you failed.
There you go.	This interview is over. I'll let you know.
I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.	Where?
Pssst. I'm having relationship problems. And since you're always having relationship problems, I thought you'd be able to give me some advice.	No need we can just check the security tapes.
Ah.	It's only Meredith.
Angela, I'm sorry.	Hey... Why did you do it?
I'm more of a dog person.	Was she talkin' back?
So what's your strategy for this race?	Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
There's bad blood, jealousies, cliques.	Oww!
All right!	You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Yes Michael?	You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
I don't think you understand how jeopardy works.	Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
nan	Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.
Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.	Hey monkey, what's up?
And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.	Sure.
I don't think so.	Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what
That's possible. Look into that.	So what do you need me to do?
I wrote it out.	Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.	Mm-hmm.
Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.	Mm-hmm.
No, that's not. That's next to cleanliness.	On your marks, get set...
Yeah. Oh we're in last place.	Hey monkey.
Darn it.	Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!	Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.	That was the sick one, right?
Can we get another round?	No.
Thanks.	Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
More or less.	So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.	Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.	You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
Yeah.	How ya feeling, better?
Sprinkles never hurt a soul. God in your infinite wisdom how could you do this? She wasn't ready. She had so much left to accomplish.	Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.	She's only a cat.
You never... you don't like them.	I am a farmer Angela.
I am a farmer Angela.	Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
Dwight please!	OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
You did kill her!?	No, I have not.
No, I have not.	I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
You put her in my freezer.	I do not respect her, but I will go.
I do not respect her, but I will go.	It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
Oh, Michael, you can't ask about religious beliefs...	Well I'm not responsible for that!
Alright, well then you can ask about religious beliefs.	Hey, Oww! It's OK.
I'm... um, Catholic.	It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
Presbyterian.	It's fine. What?
Oh me too.	I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
Same religion.	I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
That's why we're cursed.	Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
He couldn't have made it a circle?	As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.
I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it.	Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.
Well, you're probably dehydrated.	Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
Glass of water would be a start.	Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
I'm still having a nice day.	Just doing my job.
I know you Michael, I saw you naked.	So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.
Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.	Mm-hmm.
Hey Mer. How ya doing?	No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.	Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.	Take a stand!
I gotcha one.	I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.
Yeah, great.	What?
Ok. I look forward to hearing your ideas. Where do you wanna go?	It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.
You know what, you're right. I'm feeling kind of nauseous anyway. So, you know skip it.	Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna Oops, sorry!
I love you guys, so much.	Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?
Very much. How's your meat?	Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy!
Phone's ringing.	Dry. Delicious.
It's been opened.	I don't see it. I think they both could do better.
I don't see it. I think they both could do better.	Oh, that's funny.
Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?	Are you enjoying your mineral water?
Did you plan it?	Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here, it's an old sales trick.
Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here, it's an old sales trick.	Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!
Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?	No, please don't do this, monkey.
No, please don't do this, monkey.	We'll bill you.
Did you get any clients back?	To give you this.
Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.	It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
I just really like you.	And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. Don't you Garbage?
I know. I love it there.	You haven't buried her yet?
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.	Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. Look at him.
I don't want Garbage! I want Sprinkles!	Dry rot?
Oh.	Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.
Uh huh.	You're welcome.
Let's just wait and see what happens. You know?	Yes... I miss you.
Oh, OK.	Fine. Then I just want to be friends.
Great.	Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.	What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.	Got it.
Can we speak privately about our relationship?	Michael, wait. Let me go.
Ryan Howard everybody. Good job.	Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. Please.
We're screwed.	Yeah.
Us? You and me. The old timers.	Thank you.
No..	Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?
No, they have been dating for like two years. Since before your barbeque.	Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
You didn't say anything to me?	Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
Can you believe that...	Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Oh no, we're just sitting here.	The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends.
Did you even try?	Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
I can't see half of the things.	And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.
Kelly, I'm your boss now, OK? You can't keep talking to me like I'm your boyfriend.	Please, come back.
I never cared about you? Six months ago Karen Filipelli sent me an email. Asked me out. I said no, because I was committed to our relationship.	Remember what we had Larry?
We have a date!	I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.	Hello.
Hello, Dwight. I've been thinking about things and I wanted to know if you would have dinner with me tonight?	Like Angela in accounting.
Like Angela in accounting.	Really?
Yes.	Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.	I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?	You don't know?
He's such a snake.	He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
What is that... word?	Accept it, why would he come back?
So older people have just as many rights as younger people?	That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Is there another meeting scheduled, I was gonna do the Blackberry tutorial in here.	Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.
Ohh... man.	That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
Have a seat.	Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
Have a seat. Like everybody else.	No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Still my office, Ryan. Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.	It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?	This is the lake!
No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?" Yeah.	No, it's--- there's no road here!
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.	Remain calm! I have trained for this! Okay, exit the window! Here we go! Look out for leeches! Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! Michael! Michael!
I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.	I got you, I got you!
Michael Scott?	Fine.
Good, that is what's most important.	Oh, yeah. Yes!
Oh, yeah. Yes!	Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
Michael, can I talk to you a second?	I'll call a cab.
We have actual work to do.	Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
Bob, how old are you?	Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?	Yes!
There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away. And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner. Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay. I believe she thinks she saw it.	Woo!
We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white?	Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again. Announce it again.
Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.	No no no the first part.
Dude, you gotta believe.	Hey. So. What do you think? I did it for you.
Wait for it.	You didn't have to.
Hello.	Blah.
Um... uh... I'll get back to you.	Uhh.
You beat me. You are the superior being.	What?
I never thanked you for coming to the hospital.	Coopers has calamari.
Alright who wants to party?	Tokyo?
Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out.	Yes.
I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.	Okay.
Thank you.	Nice.
He beat the computer.	Woo-hoo.
This was a pretty disappointing day. It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about. But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it. I did that in the car on the way home.	Yum.
Yeah.	That's ridiculous. I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
Chocolates? Someone famous?	Later on.
Later on.	Really? 'Cause Ryan says so?
Cool music.	And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
Confetti.	I started a fire with my cheese pita.
I started a fire with my cheese pita.	I can make more sales than a computer. In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Go-Go dancers?	I date Indian girls.
I can't do this.	Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.	You believe a computer can beat me?
I can't do it.	I don't get that, I don't understand that.
I don't get that, I don't understand that.	Well I will prove you wrong.
Wanna head back?	We'll see.
No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!	Yeah, let's go.
Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat. It's very complicated. It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela. Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.	I think she's efficient.
No I'm not.	I hadn't noticed.
I told you I don't want you doing these things in here. You can use your own office or do it in the hall.	nan
And this is where I will record your sales.	I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.	Hmm. Very nice. Very nice.
And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.	No. I think you should date Kelly.
I can't tell if he's mocking me.	Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby.
Uh, she works in the annex. You're also welcome to date Toby.	Just ignore him.
Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?	I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Same thing.	Go to my car. Open the trunk. Inside you will see many pelts. Under the smallest one is a case. Inside that case is a bear horn. Bring it to me.
Are you looking for dinner and a movie? Because you're not going to find it in that box.	Got it. Carb up.
Angela, are you hearing words that I'm saying?	Hey, you wanna win? You gotta fuel like a winner.
Hello.	Uhyeaahhh! Hello, Susan? Dwight Schrute.
They say you should never mix business with pleasure. Really? Well then, explain to me how a putt-putt golf company operates.	Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
Hey	Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.	What if I told you I could offer free shipping? Sure. I'll hold.
nan	It appears that the website has become alive. This happens to computers and robots sometimes. Am I scared of a stupid computer? Please. The computer should be scared of me! I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months. You heard me right. I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.
Just...	I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.
Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.	We're a paper company. The best paper company in the whole wide world.
Sales?	Ohhhhhh!
Three hundred and five.	What did you just call him?
Oop. It just made another sale. Three eighty.	What did you say?
Okay, uh why don't you just lay off, lady?	I can make him talk, Michael.
Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...	No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what? Ah no! That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit! Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman? Ahhhhh.
Trouble. Okay, alright.	Fine. Good.
He said no.	Yeah.
No, no.	I do not look worried.
You do look worried.	Listen up kid. I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.
Okay. Um, while you were typing that I searched every database in existence and learned every fact about everything. And mastered the violin. Oop, and sold more paper.	Hey!
Oh yeah?	It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
Will you help me put it over there?	What are you doing? I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.
Okay.	Damnit Kelly! It knows! It knows what you did!
I stole it!	Return it! Return it now!
Michael, Ryan wants to introduce the branch managers in a few minutes. You just have to wave and introduce yourself.	Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?	I am not a bad person. When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them. What did I intend to do with them? Who knows? Maybe keep them as a souvenir. Maybe use them.
Different stuff.	Yes, Mr. Galliado. How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now? It's not important how I got your information. What is important is that you say yes. Good.
Wow, can we make it a different moment?	Perfect. So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.
Can I start talking? Is this thing on? Give me a signal when you want me to start.	I'm sorry. Am, so sorry. I... yes. Uh, could you repeat that?
And now from my old hometown, Scranton Pennsylvania, my former boss, Michael Scott.	Yesss! Ten reams for the US District Court! Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?
Always a jokester. How about that image? Crystal clear.	Huh?!
Ow! What are you doing?	Did you see the board?
Yeah.	nan
It's not. It's different. But it's a good book.	If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
Leaving Pennsylvania.	Ahh-chaa!
One for me one for Jan.	I'm just scaring him. The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.
You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?	Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
Wanna come over Friday?	You had to, what other choice did you have?
After work you guys...	Well, yeah.
Yep.	What will you do?
Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?	Yeah.
Yep.	So, I'm paying full price?
You know what this is like? I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.	Here we go, sixty-five. You know what? There's two more.
Yeah. I withdrew too.	Now what?
Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.	Yes!
Yes!	Alright. Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
You're being gross.	Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. Please hold. Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
What moves?	None of your business, Jim.
I can't believe that's not working.	It is not a B and B.
Yeah.	Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.
Really? Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.	I'm not telling you anything. Permits are pending. Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.	Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones.
Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.	Where did you read that?
Yeah.	Trip Advisor is the life blood of the Agrotourism industry. A couple of bad reviews there, you might as well close up shop. That's what took down the Stalk Inn. One of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see.
Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple. But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.	How many in your party?
I do gamble Michael.	We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.	One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.
I have my daughter tonight	You took that with you.
My daughter.	You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
That was cold.	My girlfriend and I broke up recently. And I must say, I am relieved. Gives me a chance to sow my wild oats. In the Schrute family, we have a tradition, where when the male has s*x with another woman, he is rewarded with a bag of wild oats left on his door step by his parents. You can use these oats to make oatmeal, bread, whatever you want. I don't care, they're your oats.
Hey cuz, heard you're having money problems.	We have three rooms, each with a different theme.
Listen, I've got the answer. You declare bankruptcy, all your problems go away.	American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
You don't go by Monopoly man, that game is nuts. Nobody just picks up "get out of jail free" cards, those things cost thousands.	I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
Bankruptcy, Michael, is nature's do-over. It's a fresh start, it's a clean slate.	No.
Exactly.	No. Jim, come on.
I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program. Fresh start, no debts, no baggage. I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton. I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs. That's the life.	Mose, bags! Now!
I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!	Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.
Okay, the green bar is what you spend every month on stuff you need, like a car and a house.	Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
A few more minutes is a waste of our time.	Stupid.
This is a trading game.	No.
You give a quick pitch. You make the sale. You move on. That's how Vikram does it.	Maybe you should. Whatever.
Table making never seemed so possible.	And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. "Harry?" It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.
Oh it looks like mixed masala, eggplant, and rice.	I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.	Uhh-mmm
I actually wrote a movie.	No you didn't.
I'm writing one, yeah.	Mmm-uh-mm
Um, sort of a spy, thriller...	nan
Ah, dinner. Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.	Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
Yeah?	Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.	Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
Jan, he went running that way.	Great.
Runaway train, never come back. Runaway and I'm never coming back.	Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
I'm gonna have it one of these nights.	Hello, this is Dwight Schrute calling from Dunder-Mifflin, and according to our records you appear to be low on office supplies. Okay, sure, yeah I can take care of that right now.
It's kind of painful and my nipples are over-sensitive now.	Pam.
You okay?	I am better than you have ever been or ever will be.
You playing that game again?	Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
Oh it has losers.	I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly.
I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking. Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?	We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.
We'll use code names.	Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
That's not different enough.	Dwike?
Has anyone ever come up to you and said, "You're not creative"?	Yes.
Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.	Andy, I can't hear this right now.
No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, "Oh D, oh D."	She called you D?
Yeah. D for Andy.	Oh D.
Oh D.	Oh D.
Alright, you are welcome. I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.	He looks like your twin.
I... will...	I will know.
Um, wanted	I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky. Yeah.
What is that guy talking about? Scranton is not lame. Scranton is the cool, fun branch. We're like Animal House.	Found him!
What are we doing?	Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?	Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
In your face	Yow!
No, I'm not calling Karen.	He's lying.
What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!	Gah-ah-hah-ha!
Are you kidding me?	No communication with the outside world Jim.
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...	Oh no, that is too bad. Shoot.
Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.	Or real bombs.
No, no, not real bombs.	Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.	Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?	I'm peeing in this empty can.
Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!	Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
Michael, watch the road!	Hey, you're making me spray!
Pull over, pull over!	I think I cut my pen1s on the lid!
I can't believe we're here, I can't believe this is happening.	Believe it.
You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.	And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
No, no, you won't do that. Nope.	Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?	Okay, Jim.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.	Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
We are in a stairwell.	We are climbing some stairs.
We are climbing some stairs.	I'm breathing heavily.
Okay, you know what? You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.	Well...
There's a guy, there's a guy.	There's a security guard coming by. Hello, we're warehouse workers. Would you like more proof?
Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.	I can see the security guard's eyes.
No, no, don't do anything to them.	I have to do something to his eyes.
I have to do something to his eyes.	The eyes are the groin of the head.
Aha!	My hip bone!
We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us.	Don't leave us!
Save yourself!	Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Dwight, could you move over a little bit.	I'm losing control of my bladder.
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!	Did you say Karen?
You good? I'm just checking on the other branches. Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...	Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Let me ask you, did you accomplish what you wanted?	Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
I'm taking Stanley.	Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.	I'm on it.
OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. Hey, what...	Let's see if any of these will work.
Hey, hey hey! Dwight.. Dwight.	I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk. People say, "Oh, it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place." Well I say, "It's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally, than by a stranger on purpose."
That'd be great.	Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way
This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.	No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.
Well, yes I would. And I would survive.	I would make sure that you were dead.
Well...	First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.
You...	And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. OK.	What are you doing?
I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- Ow! What are you doing?	It would be better if you were unconscious.
No! Gosh! Dwight. Stop it, stop it! Stop it.	Do you want to do this right or not?
Hmm.	We're here.
Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.	Here we go. Just the two of us
Here we go. Just the two of us	Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?
Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?	Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.
Right! Exactly. Knew I could count on you.	Good a spot as any.
What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --	I'm just --
Stop.	Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. Behold.
Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.	Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.
Alright, very good. Ahh, OK.	Good luck, Michael.
Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...	I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.
I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.	Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. I hope he finds it. Lunch.
Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.	About two more minutes.
Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.	Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... on.
Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well.	Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out.
Don't patronize me.	All right! What is going on here?
What the hell?	I told you.
I told you.	All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, JÃ¶rg RoÃŸkopf, and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.
How's it going?	Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
I'll make the call.	Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!	Thank you Michael.
All right, happy Friday. Well I think we dodged a bullet there.	Fine. Get outta here.
You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.	Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK. Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?
Not now Dwight, We got a call about a disturbance?	Michael, what time should I be arriving?
Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.	Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party?
Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?	Michael can come home with me.
Really?	You people. Come on. You're sleeping with me.
We got you this.	I'm gonna take you home Michael.
Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.	Alright.
Coming!	Hello.
What are you doing here?	We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
I hate my life.	So can we come in?
So can we come in?	Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.
I'm just gonna check on dinner.	Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
It's actually really good.	Hey hey hey hey. I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
And now you guys are dating?	Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.	Write legibly people.
Well put it aside. Umm... yeah.	OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...	I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.
That sounds good. Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.	That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.
That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.	The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.
She's dead? She's so young.	She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.
Oh, God. Oh...	Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. Here we go. Yeah.
Try not to be so hurtful Jim.	Jim, how dare you.
I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just...	You know what you need? Closure.
You're right. What do you mean though?	There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.
Hmm.	Come on. I'll drive.
How did she die?	I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.
God.	Yeah.
She was so innocent.	She was stoned apparently.
You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?	You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.
Oh, you move on.	Yeah.
Return.	Rhythm and blues...
Hmm...	You've got a ton of dandruff.
Why?	Taste good too.
More like "Everyone let's get your boss laid Saturday." I have an announcement uh, to make. I am moving to Costa Rica. Thought about it for a long time now. And I'm finally gonna do it. So, I'm just gonna hop the fence and jog home now.	Wow! Lot of calories.
Why wouldn't they let me dance?	Hey Michael, how was your date last night?
It's ridiculous.	I do, I have to go.
My favorite branch. How's everybody doing?	No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?
Love it. Go.	Uh huh. I'm not gonna call her.
I'm here today to do some creative problem solving about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and field your questions.	Wow.
Wow.	Question.
Dwight.	All right.
All right.	Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
This is a temporary measure to increase the legitimacy of the site.	Nice.
When will that be?	I got sofa. I got sofa.
Did the police solve the problem with the...	I got floor.
Yes, the social networking feature of the Dunder Mifflin Infinity website was infiltrated by sexual predators.	Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?
Do you want me to sing you a song my mother used to sing me, when we were sick?	I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.
It's all about creating a one stop shop consumer experience, alright? You're chatting with your friends, you're talking about the latest music, about the election	It's a lullaby.
If I'd have created a website with as many problems, I'd kill myself.	I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.
Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.	OK. Good night Ryan.
Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.	Yeah!
I'm right here.	No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.	With s*x!
Place is packed.	Fire hazard.
Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.	Women look like white slaves.
Hey, how ya doing?	Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
Ah, he basically is man. He's a regular banking wizard.	No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.	Do you live in a regular sized house?
Dwight Schrute man. How's Schrute Farms?	Good.
Insane.	Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
Weevils, what a crazy word man. What? I don't even know what that means. What does that mean?	They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Crazy. That's too much for me man, I'm gonna hit the bathroom.	You've already been several times.
Yeah.	Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
I don't know, maybe.	I'll order you some cranberry juice.
With vodka, you're the best.	Do you have powers?
Check again, Ryan Howard.	Excuse me.
Yeah?	How did you all find each other?
Wooo!	Amazons.
Let's bail.	Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait. You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
We're not going unless we can all go.	OK. You know what, fine. Let's go, two girls to a guy. Come on, let's do it. C'mon, Ryan. Move out. OK, three or four with him. Let's go, c'mon. Here we go.
There you go.	Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
It's for you. From them.	Oh.
What are you doing man?	It's not safe. Anything could have been in there. Nice try.
I... love it!! Haha, come on!	Come on!
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...	Can you breathe?
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...	Hold your breath.
And in this case...	Ready?
That's also not true.	And... go. Force it in as deep as you can.
What about a cat eating man food?	Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.
You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.	Unh! Scratch.
That's a racing stripe.	Uh, bumper's sagging.
Mmm, I doubt that very much.	This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
How next to?	Well, here are your options
I have to pick one of those?	Yes.
Can you go over those options again?	You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
Well I have the, the blue book value...	Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
Can I think about it?	Five, four, three, two...
Let me think about it--	Now. Now. Now.
Let me think about it--	Say it. Do it. Now.
I'm thinking about it--	Do it now.
Thinking--	Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
It's like I used to tell my wife, I do not apologize unless I think I'm wrong, and if you don't like it you can leave. And I say the same thing to my current wife, and I'll say it to my next one too.	Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?
Uh huh...	There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
Great	However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.
What's the pink?	Menstrual cycles.
Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?	You.
Other than me.	Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
I never said you could do that.	All you have to do it say it.
I...	Just say it.
Okay, I will think about it.	Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
No.	So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
Yeah...	Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!
What the hell is this all about? You're flipping my car for profit.	It's my car now.
I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.	Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.	I've got a Madlib for you
Like you're applying for a loan.	Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
Yeah, and I finished my work months ago!	Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay? Excuse me where do you think you're going? Oh no, no, no. You're not leaving. No! Stanley, do not walk out that door! If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
What consequences?	I will tell on you.
Yeah, I'm trying to lure these kids into my booth, but uh, kids are very wary about being "lured" these days. Thank you Dateline!	Thank you.
What do you want?	Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?	So... what else is up? Mich-
Shortcut! Shortcut! Woah! I fell in the sandtrap!	nan
nan	Ah-choo!
Bless you.	Thank you.
Thank you.	You're welcome.
Thanks.	Hello, this is Dwight Schrute. Hello?
Okay.	Hello? Hello?
Oh that would be great.	Jim, what are you doing?
I love pie.	Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
Okay.	This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
Okay. Good night.	K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.
It's not.	Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
I don't think he's gonna take anything.	Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
Oh, some kind of... alarm.	No! Pam, I'm over here!
Hi, Jan, it's Michael. I just um, I just want to let you know that I am going to go to your Lamaze class tomorrow. Um, and if there's any details you need to fill me in on, like... what exactly Lamaze is, that would be great. And I... will see you tomorrow morning. I am going to be... kind of a daddy.	Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
[sees Phyllis	Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone. Done.
Okay.	What? [turns and sees Phyllis
Okay.	Argh! Ahh!!
I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.	You did.
No! No! You know what? This is not a party-planning committee anymore! And I don't want your foot money, and I feel uncomfortable participating.	You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just-
I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw "congratulations" and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.	Oh my gosh.
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.	Yes.
What's protocol on this?	So what do we know about her?
Michael, are you okay?	I hate her too.
Oh, of course you are.	Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
No, hey.	Would that be such a bad thing?
Stop. You can let yourself be upset. He's your friend. You know what I usually find?...	What?
Woah! Cool! A bouncy house!	But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa...
Oh, hey, do you still work here?	You have it?
Nah.	Okay, here we go. Here we go. Put it in.
Hi.	Mose!
Man, someone doesn't like H.R.	N-nothing you need to know the details of.
What did you do to him?	N-no there's not.
T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.	It was playful hazing.
Y-You can-Michael.	It's not rabid.
Oh, thanks. I'm really looking forward to sitting down with you and finding out more about what you do here.	Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
I just... Um, excuse me.	Have you been introduced to Kevin?
Hey Mrs. Vance, we're all out!	He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
Cool! You drive your own car?	Yeah.
Yup. This is my car. Do you drive your own car?	Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.
Yep. Just like you.	Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin.
Hello, Holly. Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.	Well... it's my own fault.
Yeah.	From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
Oh, Holly doesn't need luck. Everyone that meets her instantly loves her.	What are you smiling about there smiley pants? You're late.
What are you smiling about there smiley pants? You're late.	No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.	Party's over. You are so busted!
OK.	There. Take those home to your wife.
Nothing.	Michael, it's time.
You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.	Dripping on me.
Dripping on me.	Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.
Hit the scales, everybody. Right on that black platform. This way. Step it up.	Happy Birthday, Stanley!
I swallowed a tapeworm last night. It's going to grow up to three feet inside of me and then it eats all my food so that I don't get fat. And then after three months I take some medicine and then I pass it. Creed sold it to me. It's from Mexico.	Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
Ronnie was bleh. Things were at an all time sad here. But then I got an e-mail from Ryan, that he was coming back to town. And I called the temp agency and I told them I will pay you any amount, just give me Ryan Howard. Give him to me. I want him. I need him.	Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
I did!	Family only.
Mmm.	nan
Hey, if you're into yoga, I take a great bikram class in Dickson City.	Attention! Attention! We only have a few weeks left. And most of you are just as fat as the day we began.
Also -- and no pressure -- the teacher? He's a catch.	I am hardly the problem, Jim.
I'm gay!	This is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction. Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin. And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
Yes.	Hello Phyllis. Do you have a minute? Listen. I'm really sorry... about what I said before. Ok? I was way out of line.
Yes.	But you know what, I want to make it up to you. There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job. Interested?
I have everything.	Sixty - forty. Hm? I'll drive.
nan	Fax this for me.
Mmm-hmm. Saunas.	It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim. If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
Wow, was it the age difference?	Ahh. We done good in there, half pint.
Hey! Jim! Um, listen, can I call you back in a little bit? I made friends!	Monkey.
No, no. I have a fiance I very much like!	Hey, hey!
I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?	And you burned over a thousand calories walking home. And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest. Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen!
No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls."	Yeah, I took your purse. What are you worried about? You look great. I can definitely see the difference.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Michael is actually killing it with Holly. And I think I know why. It's because Holly is kind of a major dork.	No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"
Wikka wikka wikka what?	Vamping.
I don't really know Ronnie. But I have a feeling I will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her.	Eh, I've been sitting all day.
Hi Jan.	She should thank me.
Cool. Thank God they found her, too.	I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise.
Hey!	Let's do this thing.
Hey!	We better.
This is so cool.	Yes, you do.
Lunch with a girl from my hall.	I do not! I do not say "Hi" Pam!
I... listen, umm, we're still good for this weekend, right?	OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
They're on the supply shelf.	What are you writing about me?
OK, everybody, let's suck in our guts.	I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
Damn it. Come on.	Ok, well played. Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
The rest stop where that soda exploded on me. Exit 17, I think. 1 o'clock.	Come on, Bernard.
nan	All right, we're set.
Leave it to me, boss. I can get this whole office to make weight. It's gonna be a little toasty in here. Good old fashioned sweat lodge.	Shotgun weddings.
Hey, Michael. I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.	Obesity-caused illnesses.
I would like to lose 65 pounds.	nan
Stanley, Michael's not here. You can eat a slice of your birthday cake.	God. Where is Jim?
Yeah.	Michael, we have a situation.
I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...	They should not be in that room.
Aww man, I really wanted to see them.	Yeah!
Michael, you don't have to buy them.	Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
To get married.	She's not a virgin, you know.
Today is ethics day. After they finish their quiz I'm going to run my first ethics meeting here. It's gonna be insaaaaane. No, it's not. I have to read from the binder.	I got it, I got it.
Hey-oh!	Yes.
Yeah.	What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
Yeah, I took intro to philosophy, twice. No big deal.	It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.
A siesta!	Time thief. Time thief! Fire him!
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?	Never!
Yawn. Four seconds.	What are you doing?
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.	Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn? That's absurd. Really? Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody! He's ti---
Personal conversation. Seventeen seconds.	There is no way that that was---
Actually not. It was really so-so.	Ok.
19 minutes and 48 seconds. What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?	None of your business.
So I guess I can assume that was personal.	Fine.
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.	Yes, maybe I'm not.
Amen. Just keep the ribs coming.	Hey Michael?
Thanks for the baby shower. It was great. And I'll see you... soon.	Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
OK.	My cervix is ripening.
Yes.	Michael! My water's breaking!
Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message.	Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
Hi, this is Pam. Leave a message.	Right. Highways or surface roads?
I figured I'd catch you walking to your car, but...	No, Gibson is covered in potholes. Your car breaks down. Adapt!
I'll leave a message.	It's about adapting to the circumstances.
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.	No. OK, no. I'm crowning! I'm crowning! Aaaaaaaa!
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?	The pressure! The pressure!
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat. Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly. Be safe.	Aaaaaaaa!
Wish you were home. Uh, anyway...	Babies are one of my many areas of expertise. Growing up, I performed my own circumcision.
I miss you.	Hold me!
I'm right here.	Cradle my head!
I'm right here, I'm right here.	I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.	Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late.	No! I don't want natural!
No. You have to just push it out!	OK!
Keep simulating.	Aaaaaaaa!
OK!	Do you have the Sharpie?!
Keep simulating.	Do you have the Sharpie?!
Yes, I do!	OK! When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
OK.	Ready?!
Yes.	Aaaaaaaa!
Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go! Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?	Butter. Newborns are slippery.
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later. That was a good story.	Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
Really...	Oh no...
Oh no...	Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it. So the baby could be anybody's. Except Michael's.
She's got an Orbit	Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
OK, what else?	Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter. For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible.
How well I remember / The look that was in his eyes / Stealing kisses from me on the sly / Taking time to make time / Telling me that he's all mine / Learning from each other's knowing / Looking to see how much we've grown / And the only one...	Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child!
Don't hit the fence. Oh no, my child!	Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!
Don't get stuck on the barbed wire!	Playtime is over!
Uh... come on.	I like to call this... the bumper test.
You know what, where is the stroller that I came in with?	Oh. I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
Hey.	350 and one penny.
Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.	400 and one penny.
Yeah, it was nice.	500 and one penny.
Yeah.	700 and one penny.
Well...	Eh, it's not worth it.
That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.	You set a date?
What are you making?	A knife.
You're making a knife with a knife?	You got a better way?
You want to talk about it?	About what?
You know I know. You know they know.	I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
Hi.	She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
It's nice to learn new things.	I was talking to myself.
Okay.	I just don't get it.
What don't you get?	Why is she marrying Andy?
Angela's not really a risk taker. And Andy's not really a risk.	That's really fattening.
We were robbed last night.	Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
Consider yourself... at home!	Ugh.
Ugh.	Get in.
Where are we going?	I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
Then you need to give her an ultimatum. Tell her she needs to make a choice. You or Andy. If she pick you, great. If not, you can move on.	Are you sure that's going to work?
It did when Bob said I had to stop talking to my sister on the phone so much.	Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...
Mm-hmm.	Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this.
I think you have me confused with another person.	I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6
140.	Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
160.	I had to get your attention. This is an emergency.
Why couldn't have you just said it? Why did you actually do it?	Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
Now you move on.	Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
Well Dwight, I don't think you do. I think you've got your answer.	Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
Well, I just think we all deserve to be with someone who wants to be with us.	Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. And you slap like a girl.
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. And you slap like a girl.	What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me.
300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice.	300 and one penny.
Wow you guys look amazing. Stanley, I thought you hated Halloween.	Will end completely!
Oh, I'm Carrie Bradshaw from s*x And The City.	That is all sir, you may go.
Da na na na na... da na na na na...	Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! Disappear.
Da na na na na.	Good morning temp.
Da na na na na...	Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning. Hello. How are you Phyllis?
Ha ha ha. That's funny. Take that sweatshirt off! Hey buddy.	Where did you get those?
Where did you get those?	Andy.
Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.	I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.	No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?	Cornell.
Cornell.	Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
I'm sitting right here Dwight.	I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.	Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it.
If you're going my way, I wanna drive you all night long! If you're going my way...	Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.
Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying "we." You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.	Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.	Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
Take that down.	Excuse me?
It's pronounced "Corn-ell!" It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!	Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
Fine.	What do you say?
Dwight!	Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
Hm. Assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. Because I called admissions and it looks like I, will be conducting your university interview.	That's a conflict of interest.
Yeah. Big one. So, should I not let you in now, or do you want to do the interview, and then I won't let you in?	Interview.
Excellent. When the hourglass strikes three, then in the room whence employees confer.	What?
The conference room!	Okay.
Let's see how well you know your Big Red history.	Bring it.
Who was Cornell's eighth president?	Dale Raymond Corson!
Mm, I'm sorry that's incorrect. Cornell's seventh president was in fact, James A. Perkins. Comprehension skills, sub-par.	Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par.
What are you writing? Can't even give Cornell your full attention?	On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
Nobody wants ...that, to happen.	Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
"Applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character."	"Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process."
"Applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations."	"Interviewer has suspect motives."
"Applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid."	"Interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in Cornell, and they are going to go to the vastly superior Dartmouth." Ever heard of it? I think I have everything I need.
I have everything I need-	And you will be hearing from the -
And you will be hearing from -	-Cornell Application Department,
which I will not be a part of-	And you will not be pleased with the result.
And YOU will not be pleased with the result!	And your affiliation with Cornell -
Easy.	I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?
I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?	OK.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.	Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
I was there. That dude is not engaged. I'm not a big believer in therapy, but I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.	The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.	No.
Uh, Pam. What do you want on your coffee?	No. Why? No.
I should go.	Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
Probably just Kelly.	Bring it on.
Bring it on.	Obviously. I knew it.
That's what I'm saying.	Sorry.
Sorry.	Yeah. What?
You were right.	What does it say?
What does it say?	I was -- I was right.
You were right.	That's impossible.
That's impossible.	I was right.
You knew it.	I sell more paper than anyone.
I sell more paper than anyone.	I knew it.
You knew it the whole time, buddy.	Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.	I knew it the whole time, buddy!
Wow.	No, but that's sometimes part of it.
No, but that's sometimes part of it.	Yeah! Woo-hoo!
Right Dwight is loud.	Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
Impossible to say. I can't see myself.	I knew it! Yeah! Ha-ha! Woo! [kicks near Phyllis' head
I miss him.	Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.	Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
Dude, that is my face!	We have our confession. I'm calling security.
I was lying.	What are you mumbling about?
How was your meeting with Michael?	I want to be here when you fire her ass.
I want to be here when you fire her ass.	None of your business.
I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?	Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
I think you should do that.	I'm being sabotaged.
Hey, what are you doing here?	And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
It's Alex.	You're an idiot.
Uh, well, actually there's something else I'd love to talk to you about. Can we go somewhere else to talk about it?	No way.
Um.	I didn't say anything
Wow.	What do you think I am saying to you?!
Why did you come to New York in the first place?	I've caught Jim talking to himself several times today. What a loser. Get a friend, loser.
You too?	Is that the Matsuhashi B-400? The world's tiniest Bluetooth? May I?
Jim, they are a poopy.	Congratulations on choosing Schrute Farms for your wedding.
Are we even sure that's my file?	Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials?
Well, there's got to be an explanation.	While I describe to you the Excalibur package. In addition to the breathtaking natural beauty and smell of Schrute Farms, I can promise you that our grounds can be catered to fit your exact specifications. I will work tirelessly for you over the coming months and be at your constant disposal. Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
Yeah.	While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
I think you mean smug	OK.
Michael, I'm just trying to --	You already said deal.
Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.	All right, fine. Brrring.
Hello?	Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
Wow, that's great, because I need paper.	Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
Ask him his name.	What is your name, sir?
I am Bill Buttlicker.	Really, that's your real name?
Be respectful, Dwight.	Yes, Michael.
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.	What? No, but I --
Sorry. That was a family emergency.	Oh, no. What's wrong?
Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!	Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.	OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
You're gonna have to talk louder.	OK, our prices have never been lower.
Son, you have to talk louder.	...never been lower!
Louder, son!	Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
Stop it! Stop it!	He --
Give me the phone.	Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
Give me the phone.	Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.	I have to put you on with my boss.
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.	Yeah!
See how it's done? Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. See what I did?	You are the master.
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.	Don't do it, Michael.
Dwight. Dwight.	Get in!
Are you serious?	Get in!
OK, what are you --	Shh. They might be listening to us.
What's that?	They might be listening to us
In this car?	You never know. Better safe than sorry.
What are you thinking?	Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
The mob, maybe NASA.	Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
How many shoes do you need?	I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
I'm not talking to you.	Who are you talking to?
Pam.	She's not here, Jim.
So I'd like to redouble my order, if you could put me down for, um --	Wait, shut up.
I'm sorry?	Shh. Do you hear that?
Hear what?	Breathing. Is that you?
Well, I am breathing, yes.	Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on.
I need paper.	Ha!
Oh, my God. You scared me.	Hear anything interesting?
What are you talking about?	I think you know.
You always say that, and I almost never know.	What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
Are you accusing me of something?	Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
nan	Ah!
Oh man, she is so pissed.	Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
She's taking us back to first base.	Do you have your money belt?
I get to kiss her forehead. I had a good time hanging out this weekend.	No, no, no, no, no. You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra.
Wingman for life. W.M.F.L	Here, let me help you.
You up for a chest bump?	Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
I'm sorry to hear the hotel was bad.	nan
Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.	You're back.
Yes...	Good. I need you to make five copies of these.
Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums.	Alright. First thing in the morning then.
What?	Who is that monkey?
How does everyone know already?	Know what?
Pam failed art school.	Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.
Excuse me?	Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
Dwight.	What? Are there two suns?
Oh my God.	Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.	It's totally unrealistic. There are no lines in the parking lot.
Are you kidding me? That's my salad.	Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.	So wait a minute, there's no drugs?
No.	To socialize. And inform.
To socialize. And inform.	Gahh, dammit! Come on!
You're taking two?	Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?	You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation. Why don't you use them?
It's not fair to you. And it's really not fair to me.	He looks great.
That was your choice	Well rested.
I bought it. It's ours. Let's go inside, I'll show you inside. So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor. Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet. Which I think will help, the color situation. Yeah, I am really sorry about this. I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there. Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood. This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so...	Also, it's icky back there.
Don't do that.	What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting
Okay, just summarize.	Okay, fireable offenses include
That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.	I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors.
Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started.	Okay
What are you doing?	I am the bait.
For what?	Men find me desirable.
No, no, no.	Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
You're the bait for Toby?	Mmhmm.
No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me.	Men find me desirable.
Toby can I see those? Ooh. What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?	Those are fighting words.
You mad? You mad at me?	I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?	Hmmm?
I dare you to. Come on.	Come on. Baaah!
What's the matter... haaaww!	Hit him! Hit him, Chicken.
Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?	Ryan. Come on, man?
No do it, do it. I dare you.	Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
I'm not going to punch you, Michael.	Are you really not going to punch him?
You should have hit him man, guy was asking for it. Once in a lifetime, man.	I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day
Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.	There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
What's that?	Frame him, for using drugs.
Frame him?	Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
I've never framed a man before, have you?	Oh I've framed animals before. I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present. And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot...	Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin. His name is Toby Flenderson and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America. I have risked a great deal to tell you this information. My name is Andy Bernard. Andrew Bernard, that's my name. See you soon.
Here?	Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay? Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy. Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.
Those are real cops, real guns. I wonder what's going on.	Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
Hey, what is this?	Search his things.
Hey, what's going on? You don't have my permission to do this.	They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
I have a reasonable right to privacy.	Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
Ahh, that's mine.	No! Michael, no!
Mmm... okay.	Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt
Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.	Yes, of course it does.
Yes.	It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
There's the x-ax...icks.	Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
Mmhmm, okay.	Wha...
Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.	My... It's not my fault you don't understand German
Or chairs?	Yeah, do tell.
I didn't hear a phone.	Mmhmm.
No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.	How could it be more clear?
Now, I have to take care of a legal issue.	Okay.
So what's it gonna be?	We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.	Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
Whew.	This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.
Hmm... mm, what's that smell?	You're gonna need to be more specific.
Manure. Get rid of it.	Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
Do you have to slaughter on our wedding day?	You wanna eat, don't you?
Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?	...I'll consider it.
See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. ...Darn! Heh.	There's a hose out back.
Hahaha!... well...	Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?
No. I haven't thought of it.	Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
I would like cat.	Cats don't make butter.
I would like cow butter sculpture of a cat.	It doesn't make any sense.
I want a butter sculpture of a cat!	Cow, goat or sheep.
Oh... ah, I almost choked.	Here's another place.
Hey-o!	So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
I work with Dwight.	He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
What?	Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister
I do.	And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
Dwight, I thought I knew what I wanted. And then, being here with you and the German Mennonite minister... it just all felt right. I made a mistake picking Andy.	I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.	What is this?
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.	You're so pathetic. How long did this take you? Three hours?
Five minutes actually. I am a black belt in gift wrapping.	Yeah, no such thing. They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.	Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my --
Ah. You brought in your doll collection.	These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil.
These are not dolls, Jim. These are commodities. Same as gold or oil.	Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season. This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn. Catchphrase
That's the Christmas spirit.	I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift. And such a genetically improbable one. Look at that. How does that happen? King has s*x with a unicorn? Man with a horn has s*x with a royal horse?
Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out.	They are now.
120, 180... 200.	All right.
Thank you so much. My daughter is going to love this.	Oh, so glad I could help.
Thanks.	Merry Christmas.
You too.	Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.
Oh, oh, oh, oh!	We got a live one! On fire!!
Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.	Aye.
Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?	No, I like Meredith.
No, I like Meredith.	Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing. In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.
Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?	I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.	There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.
Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore. The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.	Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
Dwight--	She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
...okay.	I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.	Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
I can get you one in an hour.	Really?
This is great. My ex-wife's going to be so pissed. For once daddy's gonna be a hero.	$200.
Hey, I'd like to buy one of your dolls.	Oh, that's my last one.
I was-- I was gonna get the doll.	Not my problem.
Okay. Angela's having s*x with Dwight. I caught them doing it after Toby's going away party.	Well don't look so surprised.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?	Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!
I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.	Aah!
Aah!	Come on!
Hey, has anything happened yet?	Yes!
Yes!	Where are you?
Mm-mm. It's 4	I was just jogging.
Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.	Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes
Thirty-one is humanly impossible.	Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.	Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!
Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.	Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
Yeah.	Never! Get out and face me like a man!
So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...	You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! All you do is dress fancy and sing. "La la la la la la la la la la!" What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
Wait, you still don't know...	Last year, idiot!
Hmm?	No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
Why don't... Let's...	Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that!
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...	I sa-
Ahh!	Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
No, what I'm saying is...	What?
No, that's not it.	She's sleeping with you?
Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.	She said she was only sleeping with me.
We can't figure that out.	nan
Thank you.	Wait, what? You can't take what?
I am telling Andy.	[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow
[as Jim is collecting weapons, runs to the couch near reception and pulls out a crossbow	No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
Are you serious? Ugh. Where? [Dwight stares at Oscar	Seems like you already know where.
That cannot be true! You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...	Trade seats with me.
No.	I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
Please stop.	I need a soup spoon.
I need a soup spoon.	Rule 17
Rule 17	nan
What is it?	You've got to tell Andy about us.
That is a terrible idea. One of your worst.	Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
You're expanding on your worst idea.	Do you love me or not?
I've already admitted that I do. Why do you keep making me repeat it?	Because you're engaged to Andy.
Well?	Not yet.
This is really not how this is supposed to happen.	Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
When will she be ready?	I don't know.
Is she crazy in bed?	Yes.
Okay, listen.	Eager.
This shouldn't happen at work.	And flexible.
I am already walking.	Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
Okay, what does that mean?	Might get ugly.
But you're leaving...	Have a good trip.
What are you standing for?	If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.	If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
Dwight.	Andy.
It's over.	Oh good. She broke up with you.
No. It's over between you two.	Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
You have to.	No I don't.
She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.	Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
Angela Bernard.	Will never be her name.
It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!	I don't think so.
I'm telling you to back down.	And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
Then I'll make you.	Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
Through the use of force.	That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
Nope.	Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
Fine!	Fine!
This is nuts.	What is your weapon?
Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...	Hey, this is none of your business.
Guess what? Not happening at work.	Yes!
We're gonna do it outside.	Outside of work.
None of your business.	None of your business then. Good. So what weapon?
My bare hands.	That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
I will be taking my break at 4	I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
What a coincidence.	Mm.
[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office	How'd that get there?
Yeah, finish up.	What's this?
What's this?	Its business, not personal.
Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.	Hmm. It wasn't here before.
Hmm. It wasn't here before.	Its over, Michael, its over.
Im not a shark.	Yours doesn't.
This is ridiculous.	No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.
Hi, I am well, how are you?	Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?
So what do we do now?	What if the owner of Prince Family Paper has a beautiful daughter and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?
I will seduce her.	No, I wanna seduce her.
No, I will seduce her.	Please Michael, please.
No, I got it.	You'll fall in love with her.
Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.	Okay, let's go over the plan again.
Alright, I am a local business owner. I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies	Your fictitious name?
Michael Scarn.	I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
Okay.	Then we meet at the Denny's...
No.	...and then we compare notes.
No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.	No!
No!	You know how I feel about IHOP.
Oh, don't start,	Are you socialist?
You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.	I'll have a cup of a coffee.
You will have pancakes and you'll like it.	Store only has three employees.
So what?	It means they are not expanding.
Maybe they are shrinking.	No.
They could be shrinking.	No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
Ah ha Yup.	Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.
Mm hmm .	Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.	Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
Argh, why are you all...	Get your clouds right.
Shut up.	So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it. No, no like this. Good.
Ready to do this?	Yeah.
Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? Is this the cup? Is this what I drink out of? Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.	Hello, I would like to apply for a job.
Hi, I'm afraid we're not hiring right now.	Why don't you just get rid of this guy?
That's my son.	I'm your son now
Try 80.	Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.
I sure hope not.	Me too.
Grandfather	My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings.
Hey, hey, how is your interview going?	It's going very well.
I... Okay, okay, okay, alright, thank you.	Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.	Thank you very much.
I cannot wait to contact your clients.	Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls.
Haha, we struck the mother load!	Cmon.
Wallace is going to freak.	All their top clients I can't believe it.
He's going to absolutely freak.	Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go.
Oh shoot.	You drove over that. Go back
Oh God, what was that?	That's not good.
No, no, no no. Shes hot, okay? Because if you are saying Hillary Swank isn't hot, then you are saying that I am not hot. Because obviously I am not as hot as Hillary Swank!	Oh my God.
Aw, it's alright.	Oh man,
Aw, my car.	Not good.
It sounded bad.	Yeah.
No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.	You've done more then you can possibly know.
No, no, really not necessary.	He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..
See that, the obvious symmetry of the face? That's a natural appeal of the scientific standard of coin aphelia, features that are a composite average of many features. Yes, she is attractive, but is not hot.	How much longer is this going to take?
Oh coffee, that's too much.	This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?
Gosh, well so long.	I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
Ok, goodbye Prince Family.	Goodbye prince family, should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. Bye bye.
Goodbye prince family, should be called the Sucker family. Here you go shark, let me fix your fin for you and sharpen your teeth while I'm at it. Bye bye.	nan
Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?	Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.	They could do better.
Why don't we just, live and let live?	What?
Live and let live.	I'm not familiar with that expression,
It's from James Bond.	It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
I'm not going to make this call.	Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate? Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
My heart says...	Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
That is true.	Yes.
That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.	Yeah.
Jan... Ryan.	Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
I am trying to be more optimistic in life. I've got what, 20 or 30 years left. And my family history says I have less. Now, the old Stanley Hudson would have found something wrong this actress. But that is no way to live life. Look at this healthy sexy pretty strong young woman. C'mon people! She is hot.	There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.
You're right.	Yeah.
You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.	Good, so, where are you going?
Just something I have to do first.	Where are you taking the client list?
Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone	Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No.
Oh shoot!	Freeze, give me the list!
Freeze, give me the list!	No no no, I can't let you do this!
Those people will be ruined.	Last week I gave a fire safety talk. And nobody paid any attention. It's my own fault for using PowerPoint. PowerPoint is boring. People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher. Today, smoking is gonna save lives.
It is a big deal. You almost killed Stanley.	Does anyone smell anything smoky?
Does anyone smell anything smoky?	Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay? Make a line. Just form a line right here. Sign it! Sign it now!
Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.	nan
Gimme a break.	Oh, fire! Oh my goodness! What's the procedure? What do we do, people?
Get that in there. Oh yeah.	Oh, how did that happen?
I know but if I get it in deeper...	No, we don't know that. The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?	What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?
You guys, they're making out.	Wait, wait, wait.
Hey.	No! No, Michael! No! Touch the handle. If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
nan	Not a viable option.
I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.	Okay, what's next?
You're good to talk to.	Oh! Here's a door. Check that one out. How's the handle?
Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...	Well, uh, another option.
It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.	Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone. No bunching!
Chunky monkey.	Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...
It's my bio-feedback machine..	Okay, let's go.
It alerts me when my stress level goes up so I can try to calm down.	Calm, please
Yes...	Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Let me get you some water.	Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options. Where do we go folks? Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?
No, Michael, No.	A what? A rag. A damp rag, perhaps. Let's remember those procedures. What are the options? Okay, that's the wrong way. We've already tried that. Remember your exit points. Exit points people.
Would ya, would ya step back please	What's next?
Hellloo...	How about 911? Anyone? 911.
So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.	Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.
Help!! Help!!	Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
Oh...	Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no fire. It was only a simulation.
Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin! This has been a test of our emergency preparedness. There is no fire. It was only a simulation.	Speaking of which...
Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.	Fire not real. This was merely a training exercise. So, what have we learned? Oh come on. It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
How could you possibly think this is a good idea?	May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.
May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.	A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
Electricity.	That was the last signature I needed.
That was the last signature I needed.	Shampoo.
If you ever wondered if you were Michael Scott, here's a quiz to help. If you ever put sunblock on a window, you might be Michael Scott.	I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone. Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.
If you ever called the fire department 'cause your head was stuck in your chair you might be...	Yes I shouted "fire!". I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!	When no one hedded--
You're so lucky! Good one...	N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Well...	So, you--
Pow pow pow...	And, well, I don't see my co-workers--
NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY.	Hee-heeding this right now.
Yeah... yep.	No.
No.	How dare you all attack him like this.
Oh, stop it Dwight.	PETA.
PETA.	Michael is your superior.
Do you?	Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
You talking to me?	Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
What?	You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.	Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?
No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands.	Are you calling me an idiot?
Are you calling me an idiot?	Don't you worry about that. I got it covered. Okay?
Yeah.	Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land.
Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land.	I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.
Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?	What? You?
Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.	Come on.
We are, we are a family.	That's preposterous.
Andy.	It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.
A-B-C. Okay? And hat stands for... airway, breathing and circulation.	Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
Yep. You're being replaced.	This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
Shut it. Shut it.	Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.
Caw... caw... caw caw... caw...	Absolutely I would not.
That's not a good idea, Michael.	Got it.
Michael.	Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Yeah, okay. You didn't maintain 100 beats per minute, and the ambulance didn't arrive because nobody called 911. So you lost him.	Okay, he's dead. Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?
I have no idea.	Anyone else?
We bury him?	Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card. If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.
He is an organ donor.	He is.
Yeah.	Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. Here we go.
What are you-- What are you doing?	We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
Dwight!	Clarice?
Could you tell me why you had to cut the face off the dummy?	I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.
Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?	Wow.
Hi, everyone. Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?	I have.
Let's hear it.	"I state my regret."
You couldn't of memorized that?	I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it. Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
Screw you.	Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
Go ahead.	Go ahead, you do it.
Okay.	I insist.
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.	What he said was...
Just, easy.	...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.	I am a paper salesman, this is humiliating. That's on my side.
Screw you guys. You're dead to me.	If you say screw you one more time...
Yeah, screw you, beefer, I don't forget your birthday, I would never do that.	Hey, HEY.
I guess my only wish, would be that nothing so terrible would ever happen to anyone else ever again.	Oh God.
In a way, it's good that it happened to me, because at least I can bear it.	What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
Are you kidding?	Well, I'm not done yet.
Dwight. This, fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?	They match the carpet
What is that? It is your birthday period.	It's a statement of fact.
Not even an exclamation point?	This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
I can't believe how bad this looks.	Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
Okay, good then.	Have you collected the money from everyone?
I am working on it.	How much do you have?
Six dollars.	That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
I said I was working on it.	nan
We lost the account.	Damn it! Dwight Schrute.
How old's Kelly?	Who is this?
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?	Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?	Uh, 24. 37.
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?	I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.	I have here Kelly Kapoor's personal and confidental file. Allow me to share. "Kelly Kapoor spent April 1995 to December 1996 at Berks County Youth Center." Juvie. "According to past employers, it in no way affects her job perfor..." Blah, Blah, Blah.
I am on a lecture circuit. I'm goin' around to all the branches, and I'm telling them my secret recipe for success.	Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. Many happy returns.
So, detour. We're now adding Nashua to the Lecture Circuit so Michael can confront Holly and get some closure. Nashua actually sounded very excited on the phone. I don't think they get a lot of visitors. Because their office is only accessible by cross-country skis. Hey-oh! I've been driving too long.	What did you do?
Stop yelling at me!	What did you do?
I didn't do anything!	What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
Hey! What the hell's goin' on?	Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
I was kickin' it.	In juvie.
What?	Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
Yep.	For reha-
Got it.	What did you do? Huh?
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy.	Yeah, if she's old enough to get married, she's old enough to follow the law. What did you do?
My boyfriend dumped me, so, I stole his boat. I mean, he told me it was his boat. It was actually his father's. And I just thought it'd be really romantic, like 'Thelma and Louise,' but with, like, a boat. And it was the worst year of my life. And I can't believe that you guys are making me talk about this on my birthday!	I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
Birthday.	Frosting.
There's always a theme.	Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.	Busy!
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?	Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
You know what? I could use a little help.	You know what? I'm a little busy.
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?	It's not effeminate. It's festive.
What? I'm not in love with her.	You have to write my suggestions down, too.
I'm not writing, "Horse Hunt." I don't even know what that means.	It's in the name.
Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.	You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?	Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord.
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.	Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. What about you?
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.	That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
Surprise!	Hey, it's not a surprise.
nan	Told you.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.	Our theme, if you will.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.	That's our theme.
I love it.	Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
Ooh- can she pick a half hour of each?	No.
All right.	Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go.
Surprise.	Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
Thank you.	Okay, you've got one hour.
I'm too excited to sleep.	Mm, great cake.
You didn't eat much there Jimbo.	Ayyyy!
You're only engaged once. Well present company excluded, but.	So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Yeah. She's fine.	OK, what's up?
Oh, wow look at those. How nice for you. Up there, front and center, beautiful. I think they would look better right here. They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.	Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this. You know maybe sign--
Pam, really, they're back?	OK. Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot. God!
They're for her to look at, Michael.	Thanks, Michael.
Come on, we'll all go.	So sexy it becomes hostile.
So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.	Yeah, deal with it Pam!
So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.	Having trouble finding a vein?
Yup, a little.	How about now?
How about now?	I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command. Also, I can retract my pen1s up into itself.
You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.	You're right. OK everyone, back to work.
No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.	A net? a giant net?
No. Not a giant net.	What do you have in mind?
I was thinking maybe like a mixer.	Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
Old fashioned meet market --	No.
-- I don't think it is.	Lonely people mixing with one another? Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation? Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work. Pssh. You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
Hey.	Hey. No movement.
Ah, still early.	Eh, its not that early.
So how you holding up?	I'm ok. Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
No. No, I meant about being single today.	Oh. Meh.
Meh, exactly. Eh.	Eh.
Oh, here we go.	Hello.
Hello.	Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? Hi, Dwight.
Thank you, Michael.	I can untie any knot. I'm serious. Name a knot, any knot. Go ahead.
I- I- believe you.	You shouldn't believe everything you hear. In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie. So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses.	You must use a lot of paper.
It's going very well. People are mixing, a lot of hope. Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in. Um, so it's not too late.	...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
No reason.	Is somebody after you?
Why do you always go to that? Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?	Hey, it just takes one!
She could be your soul mate.	Oh, not likely. 3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
Pam? Knock, knock.	Alright.
I know you are. Knock, knock.	OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. It really makes us look unprofessional.	So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea.
Buddha.	Pam...
Buddha this bread for me, won't you?	That is my idea.
That was helping. It was classic.	It is my idea.
It is my idea.	I got a knock-knock joke.
No... God.	It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.	OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
Alright.	Horse Boat.
Horse Boat.	Knock, knock.
Who's there?	A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!	KGB.
KGB -	Oh give me a break.
Oh give me a break.	We will ask the questions!
What the hell was that?	That's because they're easy!
That's because they're easy!	What are you doing?
What are you doing?	Women's urinals... uh...
Women's urinals... uh...	Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
You, you like that?	Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.	C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
I am gone.	I'm not answering it.
Answer the door.	Oh I am. In my own words.
I want to see it.	No way, it's the KGB.
No way, it's the KGB.	No.
I want to see it.	I'm not answering that. You answer it.
I'm not answering that. You answer it.	No, Michael.
Give me... Give me the diary.	I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB.
I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB.	No!
Hi.	It's true.
No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!	Ding dong.
I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. Umm hmm.	KGB.
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'	When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.	We have more houses to visit.
No, you don't. No, it - What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?	We will come back at... how is 4
No! No! No!	How about 5
You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'	Very well, we will come back at 5
Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.	That was your idea.
Woah, wow, who told you that?	You did. Several times. Over and over again.
No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.	You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
I'm not taking... I'm not taking...	Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.	You don't keep a diary.
Yes I do. You've just never seen it. March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.	Hold that thought. March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
Why do you have a diary?	To keep secrets from my computer.
OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.	Impossible.
Yes, you did.	I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
What are you writing?	Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?	With all my heart.
We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--	OK, what am I thinking right now?
Umm, nacho chips.	No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.	Oh, not gonna happen.
Oh, not gonna happen.	I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.	What about Shoe La La?
Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.	I love working here and I do not want to leave.
He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.	Well...
I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...	We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
Right.	No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.	Try me.
That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...	I haven't made a decision yet.
You kind of have.	No.
You cannot take the fall for him.	He said he would do the same for me.
He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?	I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight.	David... you're welcome.
Alright Dwight. This is huge.	That's what she said!
Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?	Inspiration.
Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?	You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.	Apology rejected.
Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.	Oh Pam.
Good work, kid.	Thanks old man.
This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.	Yeah.
David? David?	'Cause I've got this idea...
Yeah?	Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
No, not exactly.	Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.	Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
So is this the meeting you've been in all day?	Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
I drove.	Oh, here's one
Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?	Mr. Peanut is not classy.
Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.	He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
Clearly that's what you wanted.	Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.	Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.	I said that!
Not classy at all.	Excellent.
What?	Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!	We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
Well-	What about your party?
You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.	Ask him about the party.
I'll give it my best shot, Michael.	No the other thing.
Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff?	He hung up?
Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.	Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em.
David Wallace's office.	Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
Good. Thank you.	How's it hanging?
Alright. . .	Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Any good headhunter knows I am available.	Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
Okay.	Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.	Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in. World War II.
That's a really... well fine, Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?	Deutsch... let me see here. That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
Hmm...	My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
Ehh... well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it? Um... hmmm.. Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?	Your own paper company.
Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so	Right...
Potential, lots of potential. yes.	What a courageous venture.
It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...	Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.	Okay. So yeah.
So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.	You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.	No.
Nana. I really think that Papa would want you to do this.	Hustle!
Okay.	Way to go.
... Square is fine.	Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.	What?
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?	This is how I breathe.
We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.	If you want to tell me -
You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.	Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh!
You bet.	Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
Well I do.	Wow.
I play.	You can be so modest sometimes.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.	Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Maybe we will someday.	Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
That's a great idea, Dwight.	Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
Yeah.	I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?	Jim, what do you say?
I'm in it to win.	Game on!
C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?	Wing.
I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!	Cherry Pie, Warrant.
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?	No! Really?
Hey Kelly?	Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly.	Rebel Yell, Billy Idol
Oh, and Kelly...	Really?
What do you think?	Let me check. Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Thank you!	Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much. But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
Oh.	You know there's a ghost in this office
Really?	A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Why was she in this building?	Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
That's crazy.	Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
Oh my god!	It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
Hmm.	That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.
Oh!	Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
Yeah.	Yeah?
Just got some ice.	Erin Erin...
So I'll see you guys around!	Hey buddy.
They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?	Hey buddy, what are you up to?
Um, nerthing?	Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your pen1s.
Pffft.	Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.	And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
No, that's ridiculous.	No no no.
Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-	Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, Boom.
Country roads, take me home, to the place... Sorry. I like that song. You're good!	You're good.
What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.	Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
Really?	Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River	In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.	Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.	It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah!
Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.	Spin move.
Did you even hear the music I just played for you?	Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
That's very rude.	These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.	I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-	Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.	La la la! Continuing. Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...	'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! Okay.
'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! Okay.	Come on.
Come on.	When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
Hey.	What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.	Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.	They have some great kitchen ideas.
Good, good, good. I will see you.	It's small, I know.
It's small, I know.	Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
Excuse me?	Thanks, Michael. Wait, what is this?
It's for your trouble.	How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?	Wh- I don't need $6 to help a friend.
No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.	Michael, you know I can't take this.
Yes, I do.	But don't forget you owe me $10.
That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?	Michael.
I'm here. I'm a part of this now.	You needed to speak to me?
Dwight, take a seat.	I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?	Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.	Your concern is noted.
Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.	Like a wolf. Thank you.
And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?	Really?
Definitely.	It's firm.
I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.	I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?	No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
I'm not following you.	Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.	Good, do you see what I'm saying?
Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?	No.
Can I use it?	No.
Dwight, are you talking about us?	It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?	It is the situation that we are in now.
So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?	I'm not a barbarian.
Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?	I will.
Dwight?	Yes?
Is the cool new guy Charles?	I've said too much.
Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?	I'm sorry, Michael
He did.	I did, Michael. I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
I said forget it.	Dwight Schrute.
Hello, traitor.	I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. Bill Cosby.	Mr. Schofield, please?
He's in a meeting.	Dammit!
So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?	I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
You sound worried.	And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations!
Wow. High score?	And no, I cannot lower my current prices. Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
And no, I cannot lower my current prices. Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.	Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market. So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?	I would like to arrange a truce.
So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?	Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-	Michael.
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.	In which direction?
Toward the sun.	At what time?
Noon.	That-
You have two seconds.	Michael. Sorry.
Dwight.	Michael.
I hope you're not recording this conversation. Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.	You were making me do things that were not all right.
So you just rat me out? You could have said no.	And not come through for you?
If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.	I want a truce.
I do too.	Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
Cooper's.	I had fish yesterday.
Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?	Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.	I hit a bear.
What?	He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Yeah, sure.	Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?
Yeah.	Did you enjoy your lunch?
Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.	No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. You?	Me.
What about our truce?	I broke it.
On purpose?	Yes.
Why?	You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.	And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Oh. b*st*rd!	Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.	Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend." "Tall" and "beets."
Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, "great salesman, better friend." "Tall" and "beets."	And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. I see you're begging for mercy, huh? Well, you will find none here.
Dwight, do you mind if we talk?	Sure. That'd be fine.
If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.	This is war and that is what happens.
Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.	Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.	Michael! Michael!
Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.	Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.	Are you saying you invented paper?
No.	Shame, Jim. I expected more.
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael. Ryan is--	It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people. This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand. You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.	Been there, done that.
Hey, guys--	David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace. Charles and I were waiting for you.
Okay, great. Uh, Dwight come on in. Also, Jim.	Come along, afterthought.
God, no.	Stupid. Yeah, makes us look weak.
I agree.	I say we fill Michael's office with bees. My apiarist owes me a favor.
Really? Does he do good work or--	No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist.
Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.	Five minutes exactly.
Okay. Hey, Dwight. Can I talk to you?	Sure thing.
Good, right? Hello.	Idiot, we're starting back up. This is Dwight, by the way.
We still have the inventory sitting--	Let me float something out there, okay? Can I just say-- can I say something?
Yeah, yeah.	There is a hive of bees outside the front door. We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
Oh, but you didn't.	Oh, Man! If only Michael had children. That's how you really apply the pressure.
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.	You know what? Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me. I'm the man for this job. Charles, you got my back on this?
Are you kidding me?	Well, Jerry, the one who got away. May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company? Really? Please hold. Charles.
Dwight.	May I have your attention? The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
What? How'd you hear that?	They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money. That can only mean one thing. They're desperate. Which can only mean one thing. They're total failures.
Great work Dwight.	Quiet you.
No, I mean, great detective work. 'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?	You don't crack a case. That has pejorative connotation. That's like calling a policeman a cop. You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
What are your top five cases?	I'm gonna answer Charles first.
Because you've solved zero cases.	Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit. Missing beets from all over the farm. No footprints. Inside job. Mose in socks. Boom, case closed.
Okay, do not go anywhere near the conference room.	Done.
Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today. Got it?	I'm not-- I'm not following you.
Got it.	Wh--
Mm-hmm.	Wh--what are you doing?
You don't understand clothing, Toby. You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.	Wait, what?
How is that going to work?	Listen up, Flenderson. You're being weak and ineffectual. I'm cowboying this meeting, okay? Here are the new rules. Earth tones only. Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
You mean the clients you stole from us.	No.
No.	Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
No, you lost those clients.	That's debatable.
Ooh, where has this guy been?	You were bought out. So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic.	Fresh hot ink.
Oh, really?	Trust me, Stanley, you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good.	No, no. This goes for all of you. Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
What about Ryan?	When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately. Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink. Urine. It was urine.
Could you send her in?	Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
Hello.	Did you even read the memo?
Have a seat.	No, you idiot. There is a code embedded in the memo. Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
Oh, I can go.	Stop doing rhyming poetry. Just tell them, please. God, the simplest thing.
He will be ushering you out.	We're in crisis mode here, do you understand? The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together. And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Oh, your face! Oh!	No, you're too close.
No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet.	Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
Oh...	He doesn't like it.
I don't know, actually.	Her face is okay, but-- Jesus! What --what are you doing here?
I don't know. I saw a crowd. I thought there might be a dogfight or something--	Get out! We need to do something. I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
Those sound too harsh.	No, I'm not saying we do those things. I'm saying something like those things.
Of course. What is like a hostage?	Excellent question.
We could write a strong-worded letter.	Words will never be enough.
Strongly-painted picture.	No, pictures are too interpretive.
Can I just say something? I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.	Oh. Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim. Oh, I totally see your point. Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly. So uh, meeting is over, I guess. I'll see everyone upstairs.
Great. See you upstairs.	C'mon. Guys. Psst, listen. Now is the time for action. I'm talking action--
Hey gang. Where you been?	Lunch.
I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.	It's pony.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart. Is there anything I can do to make things better?	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Exactly.	That's my client.
Exactly. This is your first complaint in ten years.	Give me the phone.
Things have been generally good.	Give me the phone. Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
Look, uh, Mr. Bart...	Hi, Mr. Bart.
At these prices with this service...	Hey, it's Dwight here. Give me the phone.
You're not gonna find this anywhere else.	Dwight Schrute here. Hey, don't hang up.
No, no, no. Sir, don't listen.	I know times are tough right now, and I laud your thriftiness. Ryan!
Who let this boy on the phone?	Ah! Mr. Bart! Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account. He was my client for ten years!
You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time. It's okay, Ryan.	You're a secretary! What do you know?
Okay.	And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone. I'm confiscating this.
Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight.	We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
You guys gotta be kidding.	No, we gotta be deadly serious. We'll start our own paper company. The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
That's right.	Right.
I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.	Gasp. Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Whatever you guys did earlier.	I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
Just do it, okay?	I'll do--
Get 'em there. Get 'em there.	I'll do the best I can.
Are you kidding me?	Deceit does not come easy to me.
Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along. However, I rescind my apology.	That's fair.
Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to "Y".	Shut up.
This is so cheesy.	I got her!
Me, too.	I do.
Andy, that was just the ice.	Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
Yeah. It was.	Now, how can I help you?
Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?	Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
So someone is going to a court. Big deal.	It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
Are you all afwaid?	No.
Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.	All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.	Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
No. No. No.	Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.	Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?	What do you think history is?
Alright. Here we go.	Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.	You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.	I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.	You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
Dwight! Dwight!	Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
I do.	No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. It's like children singing Christmas carols.
That feels good, Dwight.	Tell me where it hurts.
Right... mmmm... right there.	Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you." No.	This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
An hour? I can't stay here an hour.	Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.	I'm gonna with the python.
But the rattler's so scary.	No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary.	What's so funny?
Wanna dance, Dwight?	Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
Mind if I steal my wife?	You can't steal what is legally your property.
I can't wait.	What do you need from me?
Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!	Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
How long will that take?	Like clockwork.
Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.	Bye Michael! Yeah!
Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.	Okay. Fine.
Tell them what happened last year.	Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
No, no, that guy who hit on me.	No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
Yeah, you don't grab these for balance.	Seven? Can I finish please?
Okay.	I'm gonna say 30.
I'm gonna say 30.	Eight?
Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! Ohh!	Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Woah. Homemade?	Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?	Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.	Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.	Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?	Why? I don't understand.
If-	Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Uh...	I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
That's...	Sly dog.
... not what I meant.	Come on, folks!
I got it.	Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
Are you blind?!	I could've gotten that, idiot!
Can you see things with your eyeballs?!	It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.	nan
nan	Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
So what?	Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
Nice job, Beesly.	Yes! We advance to the next round!
Crystal cool.	Hit it Andy!
Set!	Don't set it to yourself!
Ow, my ankle!	What happened?
I... twisted it.	You weren't even moving. Okay, sub!
You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!	Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait-
Really funny.	Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate.
Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.	Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
How do you figure?	Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
Here's an accounting question for you	Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-	Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
No way! You don't mean that!	Rolph, leave it alone!
I got it!	Pam!
Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.	Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
We'll be back!	Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! I'll get it.
Nowhere.	Extreme! Parkour!
Extreme! Parkour!	Michael... You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm?
Don't get on it.	nan
Don't... get... on. Do not.	Andy! Leapfrog!
Stay.	Yeah! Parkour! Parkour!
Come on, boss.	Okay.
Okay, I made it all up.	Jump over the camera! Jump over the camera!
No. We heard that about Jim.	Let's do it!
Michael, why? Why say all these things? Why make up an eating disorder, Stanley's affair, me being a spokesdog...	Good. Excellent. Thank you.
Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.	Yes. Umm... see those files behind Kevin's desk?
We have a right to know.	Go put them all in random order.
The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...	Then come back here for your next assignment concerning their order.
If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.	Who's the father?
Look at that! That is the inside of your v*g1n*!	Okay, let me finish this thought.
How long have you known about the pregnancy?	He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night
A week? A month? A year?	People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
Hold on a second, Cynthia.	Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.	Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
Why would we call you at night?	Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.	Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
Yeah?	I'm... I was making it.
I'm sure everything will be fine. What do you? What's the procedure, if you don't mind my asking?	AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Yes.	Hmmm, interesting. How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?
This doesn't concern you man, you need to walk away.	Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country. I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.
If we were living in Sweden, I wouldn't have to worry about this 'cause we'd have universal healthcare.	Nnnnn, that's not... okay.
Be quiet.	I'm talking about... hmmm.
Thanks T-Man, later. [fist bumps Toby}	So long Darryl, feel better... He's lying.
He has a doctor's note.	Oh? From who, Dr. J? Look, you really need to investigate this. People don't just fall off of ladders.
A guy on my street fell off a ladder painting his house. It was on the news.	Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake? Y'all having birthday cake?
That's not a very good Darryl.	Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?
Hmmm.	It just doesn't add up.
Sounds like a EMDP-40.	Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.
You're into trains?	I have been my whole life.
Wow.	I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.
That's so cool.	Yeah.
Wow, I'd love to take a look at that.	Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.
Well, you know, 'cause of the trains.	Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.
Uhh, oh boy, oh boy.	Here, get down! He's not using crutches! Get the camera!
Get over there! Get over there!	Oh, worker's comp, my ass!
I can't believe this. Hey you, ass****!	Toby...
You gonna eat all that dog food yourself?	Ooohhh... Oh man! You okay?
I tried to keep Michael in the dark. I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.	I need to see your pupils. I need to see if they're dilated.
You come to my house, bust up my trash cans, call my baby sister an ass****, and told her to eat dog food.	We thought that she was you.
Why would you think a lady is me?	Are you... are you serious? Be... cause you look exactly alike. Am I the only one? Are you getting this?
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm calling corporate and I'm filing a complaint against both of you.	Aww, Darryl.
Cool.	Wait! They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
What?	He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.
Stupidest thing I've ever heard.	Really? Then why is there new wood only on one railing? Hmmm? We should check the security tapes Toby.
Alright, yeah fine so whatever...	Yes!
You really did it...	Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.
And I'm telling them you guys sexually harassed my sister.	Phhhht. No judge is gonna believe that...
Alright, hey Michael can you pick up for one second. Okay look, I'm not going to force you into anything. If you're willing to lose Jim, fine, you just say so and we'll find another solution, okay. Is that what you want to do?	Okay people, listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...
Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?	Could you please sign my expense report?
Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.	Sign this.
Wallace sent an e-mail about a meeting next week. He wants you both to respond.	Sign it.
Sign it.	People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.
No, not without a "please."	Come on in. That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.
Come on in. That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.	Idiot.
What the hell?!	I have a complaint about Jim.
I have a complaint about Jim.	Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.
Hey, what are you guys doing in here?	I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?	Jim won't sign my expense report.
Jim?	No, that is huge.
What does a bean mean?!	This has to do--
Why can't you? My time is just as valuable as yours.	I'd like to lodge a complaint.
This is how you make this important decision?	You!
It's not so much that I might not get a raise. It's just demeaning!	One minute ago.
Yeah, I would, too.	Angry.
Angry.	Are we idiots? What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!
I say no.	No.
No.	No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? Okay.
nan	No.
How you doing?	No.
Oh, what are you usually?	Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.	I'm not cr-- uhh!
I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?	I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!
No! How is that gonna repair Ryan's car?!	This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--	What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
Yeah.	Her kid needs shoes, Jim!
I am so pissed at this company!	And Jim!
Yeah. Who said that?	I think it was Creed.
What are you doing?	Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.
The peeing is fast, Oscar. It's getting my tie back on.	Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
Oh--	Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
No.	We'll see.
People are like cats and dogs these days.	Toby.
This used to be such a great country.	I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
I don't know what happened to it.	Crap. Come here you.
Hey. What happened?	But you can say that about anything.
Well we are here now, so let's just--	What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.
You look great.	It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
Mm-hmm.	I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.
Yes I did.	Yes.
Go ahead. I think it's your turn.	For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
Yeah, I'm okay.	Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.	Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video. I knew we'd need a back-up plan. The boat was actually Plan C. The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago. Pretty much the day I met her.	She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
Is that all you have on her?	What? It's a casual, social outfit.
What? It's a casual, social outfit.	Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
You're an idiot.	No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during s*x.
Oh no. That wouldn't be fair to leave Kelly alone in back.	I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.
Yeah?	Nine and three-quarters.
She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.	I invented a device called 'Burger on the Go'. It allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers, or 12 sliders, from a horse without killing the animal. George Foreman is still considering it. Sharper Image is still considering it. Sky Mall's considering it. Hammacher Schlemer is still considering it. Sears said, 'No'.
Yeah.	Michael.
Oh.	Drop this one. Abort.
We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.	I found twins.
Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.	What? No way!
What? No way!	Aren't they magnificent?
They're men, Dwight.	Oh. God.
Oh. God.	I love finding a good set of twins.
Something is wrong with you.	You know what? I made you a cd...
You call that a robot? Try being more robotic, ok? Like this.	Mmm-hmm.
How about a little bit of this.	This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
What else you got?	You're gonna like this. "Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--"
What else you got?	Yeah. It's practical.
Uh...	The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.	Hey-O!
Pam, it just happened.	Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number
I love you. Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!	And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?
Are you pushing me off the phone?	Ok.
Mmm! It's after midnight.	No way. What if I meet someone?
I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight.	Congratulations.
Congratulations.	No. No.
I would do the same for you.	Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.	You would?
Yes.	You'll have Pam to answer to.
You'll have Pam to answer to.	Really?
Yes... just go--	"Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV."
"Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair. I want to watch TV."	Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
Are you sure this is the right way?	Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
Well, at least slow down a little bit because every little bump in the road is major pain on... my scrotum.	Please?
I was trying to liven things up a little bit. I was kinda doing your job so--	Mmm-hmm.
Well it's also to make sure that we have a great time at your stupid wedding, so--	Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding. Ah yeah. She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.	No you do not.
No. No that was real.	It worked.
So, which one is Pam's grandma?	You have everything?
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?	Cell phone? Charger?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.	It really is. I'm not hungry. I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep. And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding. She needs you Isabel.
Oh.	You know it.
Hi.	Okay, get out of here.
Nice to meet you.	Okay.
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.	Really? I hadn't noticed. Too busy knocking boots.
Pretty sure everyone heard that.	I'm ravenous after a night of love making. You?
Hey, Mema.	Hey, what was she like?
Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.	Brides side or grooms side? Or townie?
Mr. Beesly. How are ya?	No kidding.
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?	I bet she had hairy armpits.
No.	From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.
From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.	Isabel was nice, but I hope she doesn't think this is going anywhere.
Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?	Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.	No.
She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?	That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.	Oh please. Put a gun in my mouth.
Pleased to meet you.	Look. She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one. She's a bumpkin. Pass.
She thought I was your boyfriend.	You should ask her out.
Head table, where I belong.	I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.
I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.	It's just for family.
Thank you weirdo.	Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her. In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
Okay, here I come.	That's a very good record.
Is this allowed?	Knight Rider.
That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.	That was an intelligent comment.
That was an intelligent comment.	No.
That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.	Oh. Fine. Isabel, nice to see you. What do you want?
Oh. Fine. Isabel, nice to see you. What do you want?	Very smart.
And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.	So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.
Well the "fun" is in it.	I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?
Golf.	It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.
Stock market.	Do you know what "snap decision" means?
Dave Matthews.	It means like this.
Jim's gone on his honeymoon. So I started borrowing his office to fart in. Then one day I came in and I just stayed. Cause this place is awesome. It feels like home now. Even better than my home. My home sucks.	We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.
He's alive. So you're welcome.	I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.	Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.	Not the living in fear, that's new.
Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.	Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
Okay, well.	Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?
Do your worst.	Yeah...
Would you look at that people? What an unpredictable world we live in, huh?	What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
What happened in there?	Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown? And that happened.
Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.	Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.
Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.	Did he threaten you?
Mobsters are!	It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.	I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob?	And he made us all look like chumps!
And he made us all look like chumps!	No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?	Exactly.
What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?	Okay that's-
Oh no. Fabulous.	That's good, let's wrap it up.
Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!	No I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it "murder." And not "muck-duck."
Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.	We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.	Lock your door!
I'm not gonna lock my door.	You successfully backed down the mob!
It's Michael, he thinks he's being shaken down by the mob. I don't know how you usually handle this.	Very close.
Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.	That's bad.
Go. Any questions?	That's bad.
Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.	He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
Shh!	You know what?
That's not gonna happen.	That's an exaggeration.
I was thinking exactly the same thing.	No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
Dwight...	The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.	Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.
Okay.	Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.	Do you know how to use it?
Should I change?	You're wearing loafers!
Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.	Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
Oh my God!	You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
Hi.	Hello.
If you want to supplement your coverage, we can do that. If you want to replace your current coverage, all the better. Ah, you seem like a nice guy.	Oh he's not that nice.
I don't, I don't have to have that.	What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
That's okay.	Bring him the gabba-gool!
I don't...	He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
Okay, okay okay.	So we're choosing...
Yep, all right.	Check out Dental?
It was before, my tech- my technical training.	Don't do it!
Do it.	Don't.
Look Mike, I don't know what your friends are telling you, but you have to decide for yourself. Are these guys gonna take care of your things if you die tomorrow?	Yes.
I'm good...	Yeah!
Hey Pam, could I talk to you for a sec?	Its Jim and Pam, Michael.
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light of everything that's happened today, it would be a good idea if today, you, me, and Michael could head into the conference room for some conflict resolution.	Yeah...
Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will.	This conversation has two items on the agenda.
Well, that is not gonna happen!	Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... con-quack-ulations!
Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.	You're welcome!
Michael, let me make this very easy for you, I could give a sh about your happiness! Stop dating my mother!	I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.
You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder.	I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.
You know what it means.	Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.
Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.	Well, I had to, I mean... Kelly was not even...
I think it'll be okay.	I'm sorry.
Great.	Mallard. I put it in your office in order to surveil you. I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.
I have recently taken a lover.	Oh, I'm equipped... I can...
Pam's mom.	Don't tell Michael...
Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?	Punishment fits the crime, I accept.
Get the hell out of here, idiot.	"We have our high quality 28 pound bond, our heavier 38 pound bond, or our..." I've got eight hours of this. Of course I wanted Jim to find the mallard, make him feel safe. Did you really think I would put my primary listening device in a wooden mallard? I'm not insane. "...65 pound cover stock, which is the heaviest paper that will still feed smoothly through your desktop printer."
nan	You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
Okay.	There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...
Feels good.	There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...
I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.	...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.	The Nard Dog... what was that all about?
I know, right?	What were you talking about in there?
Who wants to help the world one step at a time? Alright, good.	Volunteerism is important. Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there. Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.
Shut up Oscar. What is wrong with all of you, he is sleeping with my mother!	I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.
Hi Dwight!	Shh!
Well, I think I have that persona.	Where did you get that mallard?
What the hell is a mallard?	That!
Oh, Professor Damien D. Duck, Jim gave him to me.	Okay, I gave that to him that as a gift, I'm taking that back.
If you take it back, I'll scream.	I'll give you five bucks for it.
Twenty.	Ten.
I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.	I'm Jigsaw, idiot.
Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.	Play it again. He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
What are you gonna call him?	Judas.
Dave.	Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-
It rained.	Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
Ok.	Michael?
Yes.	A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
And when you fell in, did you flounder?	Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right? Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.	I don't want people making fun of my nose.
Your nose?	It's too small.
Oh my. That is small.	Just, write it down, please.
What keeps your glasses on?	Hey! It's on the list, everybody.
No, no.	Thank you.
Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.	Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
Well, that went pretty well.	Good morning everybody. Who would like an authentic New York bagel? Hmmm? Stanley?
Because of all the good work you've done.	No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.
That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude.	Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?
Yeah, I'll take it.	Oh, don't mention it. You owe me one. You all owe me one.
Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached. And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.	Good morning Michael.
No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--	Hungry?
What?	Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.
Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?	You're thinking of deer pen1s.
Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--	Regardless. That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry. Bagel?
Okay.	K. I brought cheese too.
Okay.	Excellent.
Okay.	Okay. You owe me.
See you then.	Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore? Geez. When did everyone get so cynical?
See you.	Pam, would you care for a bagel?
Hey.	That's right. You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time. I'll try again. Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
Okay.	Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
My money's on Pam.	Wow--
Michael could win.	I will.
Why can't you just agree with me sometimes?	Let me get that door for you--
It's okay guys... I can handle this. Everybody can go home.	There you go!
You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?	Oh... goodness... thanks. You know, here's a healthy fitness tip. If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.
Are you ready?	Observe.
[goes to punch Michael	Right?
Michael, you have to put your hands down.	Yeah, feel free to use that. Anytime. Okay.
Okay! Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.	And that needs to be straight as an arrow.
So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.	Thank you very much for that.
Maybe that--	Have a seat. Allow me.
Yes.	You know what? I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.
Okay. I promise. For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him	No, no, no!
Are you okay?	Andy is complicating things. But I'm not worried. This will only up my game.
What table should we take? So many to choose from.	[walks with Michael back into the office
Oh my God!	Let's get some raw meat on that face. I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.	Good, good. Keep it on there for another five minutes. Just let the swelling go down.
Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.	Fire Jim.
Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.	I'm cashing in the favor. Fire him.
Sticking with 49.	Do it. Promote me. Tri-managers.
That's funny.	Can I have an office?
Oh, burn. Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too.	You know what you can keep your stupid favor. It's worthless. And this is my dinner on your face. I'm keeping it.
Aye-yi-yi!	What's going on in here?
Andy bought lunch.	Oh... no... really?
Yep, yep. Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.	There is no book. There's only a survival guide.
You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.	Okay, well, allow me. You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make. I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!
Whoa, whoa Dwight. I'm going to do this.	Hey, hey, hey-- relax I got it covered.
No, I insist.	No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.
Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.	Don't worry about it. You can just owe me.
Ahh.	What's going on?
Stupid things wedged up there. No one in this office will help me.	Alright, move it.
What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something? That is a recipe for a ghost.	Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.
It's like a little envelope-- there you go.	Got it. To Dwight. Wha-- Starbucks gift card.
Surprise! It's from everybody. $15 value.	Dammit. I am no closer to taking Jim down. What a waste of a day. I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. They're mushrooms. They don't get that high.
Yes. Join me please, won't you? I am going to give you a raise.	Got you! Broken arm! Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom! Broken Nose! Boom! Ha, gonna flip you!
Yeah, I want to go home.	How can I pose this to you in a relatable way? You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives? You cannot go wrong with a throat punch
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.	No, there is a defense for that. Let me demonstrate. Someone attack me. Kevin, go!
No way. Last time you pulled my pants down and then you tried to choke me with my shoelace.	False. I did choke you with your shoelace. Now come at me!
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.	That is correct. Unless there happened to be measles present.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch. Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?	Easy. Allow me to demonstrate. I am attacking myself with a throat punch. Here it comes. Block. Grasp wrist as such.
And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.	Good point. Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut. Uh oh, up to the nose. No, you're not. Ow! Oh!
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.	He really is, but not for long. Ow! Instep, oh, not again. You let go, you let go. Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.	The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise.
It was hilarious.	Michael?
Yes?	What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.	This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
Woo hoo, shout out!	Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal. I just want to stress that it's all conjecture. If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory.	You know what? You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows. It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
Customers have to use the coupon code from the website. And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.	He needs me. Seat saved infinity.
You know, I think I'm supposed to say something to Pam, I mean, Deb, OK? I overheard you asking the butler where the pistol was kept.	Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm the butler. You were listening in on that? You rich people. You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.	I will poison your food.
Alright, a plan it is.	Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.
It's not my fault, I was exposed to Harry Potter.	I know you did it!
I know you did it!	I know she didn't do it. It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most. Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.
No it ain't.	Frankly, I'm not surprised. A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.
I thought it was for real. So I was excited, but it was just, it was part of the game.	You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?
I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.	Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir.	Answer me.
You are out of order.	You are out of order.
I'm the dead body and these are my brain chunks.	Hey shut up. You're dead.
Super.	Oh, this could be a juicy one.
I didn't do it!	OK, everybody just calm down.
On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.	I have crossbows.
We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?	OK, I'm ready.
It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.	Bow down before Recyclops.
That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.	Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?
O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. What are you doing?	Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?
Wow, man. That -	Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.
That was embarrassing.	Recyclops will have his revenge.
You -	Recyclops destroys!
He's our best manager? Where's the off button on this moron?	Yes.
nan	Polluticorn wishes.
He can take the bus. He's had his limo ride.	Humans are terrible for the environment.
Mmm.	Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart.	Yeah.
Lose the twirl.	The twirl sucks.
Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.	What kind of mileage does this baby get?
Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.	Calves. Calves all the way.
Definitely.	Smells like it.
Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.	Word.
I will have to answer.	I'll ask you a question.
Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.	Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
Kay.	Good luck, Michael.
For those of you with questions, please line up behind one of the four microphones that have been placed in the aisles.	Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Ah. Damn it. Wha- okay
Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Ah. Damn it. Wha- okay	I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.
Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?	How is he gonna have grandkids?
Sure.	No. You will not.
Excuse me?	Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?
It'll just be a second.	Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.
... and we're confident. There are many things to be optimistic about in Dunder Mifflin's future and one of them is here with us today. Michael Scott, Scranton Branch manager.	Yes.
Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.	Apparently.
I don't-just people. For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.	Not now, Temp.
Tank you Mr. Elwis.	What? Diabolical plan? I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol...
Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.	So what do you want?
Jim's talking to Michael right now. They totally went for our idea!	Yeah! Your idea.
Yeah! Your idea.	My idea. I just need Andy to think it's his idea. So it won't get traced back to me. In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace. He will be fired.
Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?	Hey Jimmy, what's up?
Not much.	Cool. Very cool. I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
Thanks Dwight.	That laugh is so infectious.
You're creeping me out. I'm gonna go.	I didn't mean any of those things I just said. And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud. Make it about the work.
Let me guess, you think you should get it.	This encompasses all available data. Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation. Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency. Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
Well, in an ideal world...	In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense."	I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
Wow!	Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
Hey.	So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
Jim said that?	He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
Jim said that?	You seem suprised.
No, no, that makes total sense.	Hey buddy, so every-
Sure.	Five minutes ahead of schedule. Right on schedule.
Are you kidding me?	Oh, no!
Dwight?	Yeah, you said "In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize." Isn't that what you said?
Okay.	My idea!
That's fair.	Excellent idea, Pam.
How is that possible? No offense Pam, but how the hell is that possible?	There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
"It could only be you!" Way to go.	He knew all along!
David Wallace's office.	This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
No, he's in his weekly staff meeting, can I take a message?	Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.	This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace.
This is Stanley Hudson. Jim Halpert is a menace.	It's Toby Flenderson. Listen, things are getting really bad down here.
I really don't know how it happened, David.	I know how it happened.
Uh, hey, I'm sorry. I'm taking this out on you.	No!
It's been crazy here. You know I think you're doing a great job, right?	What?
Yeah. Thank you.	No.
Okay. Hey, we still on for dinner this weekend?	What?
Okay.	Oh, you're kidding me!
See you.	Damn it!
Yes.	Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--
I didn't say anything!	--the party planning committee...
We're going out of business!	But effective, look! On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
What?	Merry Christmas. Good.
Merry Christmas. Good.	You are kidding me!
You are kidding me!	My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.
Wait wait wait, who said that?	It is time to unveil the tree.
Hey, Rockefeller Center!	When? When did he tell you? Today?
Uh, I have actually been to Rock Center, and this is nothing like that.	Awww!
No, it's not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie.	Aaaarrhh!
Aaaarrhh!	It is warm feelings.
Come on!	Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight!
David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.	Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...
Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.	Exactly.
Hey Sweetie, what is it?	Everyone.
Michael, I have never-	Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
Ever, ever...	Like the spirit of Christmas!
We're supposed to applaud you for taking a giant diaper off fake tree?	Hey David.
Hey David.	This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!
Well I think we're past that now.	Hey Santa!
It's going to be a very jolly time if you've been good!	Yeah!
Oh then nothing but a lump of coal for you!	I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known. Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone.
What if you've been really, really bad? More evil, and strictly wrong?	It's true. We all walk alone.
Yeah.	My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me. My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating...	For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!
Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.	I have no idea.
Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?	Michael? Please! Come on!
No, I'm not gonna do that.	Oh man! I can use this for so many nuts! Macadamias, Brazil nuts, pecans, almonds. Clams, snails...
All right, just say "some toys" please.	It's real slippery out here.
Aw, Michael!	Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.
How do you know it's a gun?	What else does it look like?
Not a gun.	Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
Well, unless the missing piece is a gun, you don't have a gun.	Not a gun.
This just arrived from the Dunder Mifflin North Pole branch!	We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot.
Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?	Yes!
You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.	What's your pin number?
"It's fun to stay at the -"	Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...
- follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two.	Oh, we will. Have a seat.
So, um, the manager, Michael Scott... is a bit of a character.	He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
What are, are you doing at my desk?	Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
Come on, Dwight. Get out of here.	Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host. Welcome.
That's, that is true.	Thank you, so much.
Have a great day.	Hope to see you soon.
Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon. Called my man, Dwight, just to see what was shakin'.	Yo, Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
They call it Scranton!	What?
The Electric City. Scranton!	What?
The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider.	But check that it's covered by your
Plenty of space in the parking lot.	But the little cars go in the compact spot!
Snack attack time.	Don't lose your head.
They call it Scranton!	What?
The Electric City. Scranton!	What?
The Electric City. Scranton!	What?
The Electric City. Scranton!	What?
The Electric City. Scranton!	What?
Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.	Here we go. Oh! Wow.
Well, it's a mess, what a mess. What you gonna do? You're going to take out your Suck It and you suck it. Suck it. Yeah, take out your Suck It and you suck it.	Impulsivity and inattention to detail.
Yeah!	Terrible mistake.
Yeah!	Undistributable.
Yeah! Take out the Suck It and we'll...	Impossible. He opened it like an ape.
Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.	Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?
We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?	So excited.
Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.	Oh. Of course.
I don't know what they're made of.	They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.
Hey.	I'm not seeing anything under "confirmation."
You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.	Could it be under "affirmation?" Cause you have thousands of those.
Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.	You did get the e-vite to my barbeque!
I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.	Michael...
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.	Wait, I got it! Confirmation code
You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management?	Thank you.
Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.	Hello.
Oh!	I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.
This is Accounting.	Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he what? Michael!
Hi!	I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.
Over here is Meredith Palmer and Creed Bratton.	Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
That is Jim Halpert, he is the co-regional manager of this office.	Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
Oh, he is. He's the co-manager, and that's the other co-manager.	It is not "farm boy swill," I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
I think that's it. So we're all good! Thanks ya'll.	I, uh...
Mm!	Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. 89... 88...
Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. 89... 88...	You're twenty minutes late!
Um, I was at another dumpster!	Just admit you lost track of time.
Just admit you lost track of time.	Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.
Did you see Saw?	Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.
No, uh, the movie. Did you see the movie Saw?	Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
Okay, the reason these movies are so popular, is the element of psychological torment.	I like where you're going with this. Continue.
Could we lure him into an old warehouse or something?	I have an old barn!
Yes!	It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
We do what they did in Saw! ... I mean, we don't kill him, obviously. I have a mask...	Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
Well suggest something else then! Don't just...	He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
Don't just criticize my idea!	Think!
You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.	The new IT guy. Nick.
Nick.	I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
Like Frodo!	Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
Well, I think he can be corrupted. Like Gollum.	Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.
Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.	I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.
Nice!	You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
Why not? It's part of the sales experience.	It's not really 1992 anymore.
It's no wonder that Andy gave Kelly such a romantic card. I can't compete with her. That girl can sing, and dance, and gets all of her clothes at the mall. And I feel like such a fool for thinking that Andy was only going after one girl, cause Andy Bernard is a playboy. And, why shouldn't he be? He's got it all.	Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.
Uh, yep.	I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
No, I actually don't.	Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
I think that you should call the cops.	No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.	Michael, it's Phyllis.
And you guys are okay with this?	She sent an email, so.
Yes, congratulations.	Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Wait a minute! You can't do that. You cannot exploit your baby for sales.	Let's go!
Well, you're doing a good job. Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you. Okay?	No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!
No, no! You need to come by your sales honorably!	Michael!
Please do.	Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.
Hey there. Dwight Schrute here. Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ... Yeah, I could sure use the money. My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus. Oh, it's just horrific. The doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly. Okay.	This is where I saw that deer last week.
Oh, shoot.	I need a baby. I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one. Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life. Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
Kevin, you're such a gourmand.	Right over by that fence.
I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner. One last ultra feast.	Let's go!
Mmmm, that sounds great. What are you thinking?	I love escorting people. In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service. I got a lot of responses. Mostly creeps. Made a few friends.
Alright, here we go! You're doing great! She'll be here soon.	Hey, what's up, kid?
Michael!	Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts. Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
Stop texting, put your phone away! Come on.	Very well.
I cannot wait for that joke to be over.	Ugh, alright. Let's move! ... What?
Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car...	Are you kidding me?
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.	Dwight Schrute.
Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.	Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday? I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Really, really fun.	Ha, nerd.
Ha, nerd.	I don't need a key.
Yeah, me too.	Bare my child.
Bare my child.	No, no, don't, don't tell me. Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
Yeah.	I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother. If you agree, say nothing. If you disagree, say anything... Very well. Let's meet at 4
Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.	Isabelle. Hello... Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
No, let's let her rest. I'm sure there's still twelve on each.	Yup.
Guys, guys!	Oh, it's... In the backyard. I'll take this.
Oh... Well, I'll let you get back to it.	Have a seat.
Eleven pounds...	Hey, listen. I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning. You know, just for fun.
Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.	Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
Yeah!	Are they now? Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right? Ha ha.
Yeah...	It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
Congratulations. That's great.	Alright. I'll call you, kid.
Do that.	Now, then. Let's get to it, shall we? Item one
No, I don't.	Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod. I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it. What I did find, was mold, and lots of it. So, I did what anyone would do. Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it. I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets... Time to get to work.
Okay, alright, thanks... Okay, do you want to eat? You want to try eating? Okay... Okay, let me... Just you and me. Come on. There we go... Yeah... Oh, yeah. Like that. There we go. You got it.	Acceptable names include and are limited to
Hi. We did it.	Jonas.
I used a variation of your move.	Warf.
Andrew, what about you?	Two forms of ID, please.
Two forms of ID, please.	Okay. Fine.
Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin. I'm just waiting for the stars to align. Literally. I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.	Nothing.
Nothing.	Irrelevant question. Section 5A, child shall be male.
Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?	Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick... I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair.
Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice. I feel sick... I couldn't find the iPod... Give me a couple days. I'll be out of your hair.	Yes you can.
How we doing?	It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after s*x, and then extremely cold for five months.
Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?	No, no, no. Ambulances are emergencies only. You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Okay.	Has anyone checked how dilated she is? This is ridiculous!
No, I mean, it feels... pressure.	"We" don't.
It doesn't... Why don't you bring your baby over here... She's beautiful.	Doesn't matter. I'll escort you!
Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.	Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
I'm so sorry I was so sick.	Mega-Desk.
Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!	Command central.
Drinks are on me!	Surveillance, gaming- and business.
Oh -hoh! All right.	Okay. Come on! Jim!
Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late? Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something	Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something.	What the hell is this?
Morning, honey-pile.	This is not Mega-Desk.
It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.	That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
Yes it is!	Hello, Dwight Schrute?
No.	Great.
No.	Thank you.
No-no-no-no-no.	Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
Is this yours or mine?	They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon.	Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
It is. Big time.	Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
Pretty amazing.	What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.	I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
Is that what happened to you?	I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
That's a common mistake.	Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.	Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
What?	My headphones are broken.
Right.	Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Yeah that's great. Great.	Okay? "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-"
Please stop that!	"-But we'll be together then-"
Can you grow up?	"-Dad, you know we'll have a good time then."
Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!	Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.
Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working.	Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening I have...
Sorry Sugar. What'd you want?	Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.	Oh
In my condo complex.	Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.	Hey You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -	Yeah
Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read	Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?	Hope - grows.
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?	Woo hoo!
Dwight?	We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room.
We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room.	Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
I would like your undivided attention, please.	Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only
Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only	You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
Go on. I have warm blood.	Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
Yeah.	When I was asking about the leads.
M-hmm.	... is there any news on the leads?
Is that all you have to say to me?	Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! Alright, Dwight out!
Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! Alright, Dwight out!	Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
Lower	What are you doing, idiot?
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.	Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
Lincoln.	The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
It involves you too.	The leads are in?
The leads are in?	Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.	Kevin! Damnit Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
You are never going to find them.	Really.
I'm going to enjoy this.	Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
I'm still enjoying it.	Where are they?
Turn the trash. Turn the trash.	Turn the trash It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
It's coming off anyway.	Clean sack.
If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.	It's empty!
Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.	I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.	This place has gone to hell.
You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.	Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
You've changed, man.	Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.	Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.	When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
Assistant to the managed him -	Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
Yeah.	Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
You think you would have done better without me? Really?	I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -	Kung-fu movies!
You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -	Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
That's my wife you're talking about, man.	Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? You watch it!
If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.	Don't do it
No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. No, time out, time out. Time in!	No!
Don't even think about that	Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.	Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.	Not counting the last one, 25.
She can't talk to us that way.	Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!
You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?	Okay.
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.	And one girl push-up.
What's your drink?	25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
No, I got that.	With this move, he can't get you.
I am in.	Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me. I would be like-aaah!
It's a deal.	Sh-what?
Okay.	No, no, no. Blah blah blah blah!
They're both single, I have a sense they might-	What are you-
It is not that. Kevin! Oh!	Angela...
Hey, how are you?	You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Aw!	Angela, not here!
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.	You are an impressive specimen.
And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-	Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
Mm-hmm.	What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.	Ooh, I love repartee.
Do you?	Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole.	Any brothers or sisters?
Three brothers.	Really?
Two are in the Marines, one's a cop.	Vegetarian?
No. I love meat.	What's your blood type?
O-negative. Universal donor.	Universal donor.
Universal donor.	Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?	Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
Whack!	Extend the fingers more.
Whack!	Good.
This looks like a hoot.	Hey, monkey, how you doing?
Whack.	Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Okay.	Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
It's no worry.	It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
I could see enjoying that.	No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
But we signed the contract.	Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
Oh, I like his butt.	Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
You tricked me!	Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.	I love that show.
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.	That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
I do.	nan
I literally did not know that existed until this moment.	Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
What's up?	Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
No, no, he's right.	Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?	All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?	Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?	Yeah pretty much.
Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. Ok fine. You too Dwight.	Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.	Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. Gabriel, I apologize.
Great.	I kneel before you.
Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.	Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
Can I buy everyone coffees? "Or cookies."	What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.	"I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit."
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?	How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
Holy cow. I'd be so happy.	Guten tag, Herr Michael.
Guten tag, Herr Michael.	I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.	I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
La telefona.	What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... I should have been more specific.	Yes.
"That's what he says?"	Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
Angela. Michael.	I can protect you from Kelly. Will you get out of here? Seriously.
Uhh!	Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program "print in all colors" initiative.
You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, "I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee."	Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.	Caucasians, am I right? Have a seat. I'll translate.
Caucasians, am I right? Have a seat. I'll translate.	You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.	You don't know what you need. Just...
You don't know what you need. Just...	If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?	What is this?
Great.	It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.	Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it.
Thank you, Dwight.	How do I apply?
How do I apply?	Oh.
I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.	Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?	Gosh. He he.
Because I never forget anything.	Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.	Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.	Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
You were right.	One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
You were right. I'm sorry.	Oh, man. White people, right?
I'm sor...	Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
What happened?	I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! I kissed. We kissed.	I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
Oh, Michael.	I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. I did do it!	You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.	That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. Good luck, wingman.	How as being a minority affected you?
Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.	Oh, good, and you resent this because...
Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.	Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
Okay...	Hey... what are you guys doing?
Oh, that is so good.	You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.	Ryan? What does he know?
Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.	"We?"
And then the two of us are cleanin' house.	Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.	Kelly is disqualified!
What?	You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
Yeah, but she's not white, though.	Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.	Kelly is the only applicant.
Namaste.	Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
There what is?	Stop it!
Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?	You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.	Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
You have to settle down first.	Michael, come on.
Okay. Okay. Yes.	Fine. Hey. Tap away.
How about Thursday?	Eel fishing.
Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna	Are you nuts?
Make it higher? Okay.	Oh, no.
Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.	Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.	You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
You do?	No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.	If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.	Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.	I think I've got one for you.
This is you. How much do you charge?	$100 a day, plus expenses.
I'll give you $50. Money's no object.	I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
Okay.	And you might not like how I find it.
Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said "Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient."	Hi stranger.
Oh, hi. You work for Michael.	I work with Michael.
Right.	Dwight Schrute.
Donna, hi.	All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
All right.	Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time
Thank you.	It's all yours. Ah!
You okay?	Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.	Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.	Oh. Oh. Oh. One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
Nope. I'm good, thanks.	Really? Hey, um...
Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?	Get out of my way. Huh!
Get out of my way. Huh!	Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
I'm out of here.	Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here
You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.	Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh!
You're back. What happened?	Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
No, what happened with Donna?	Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here.
Ugh!	Put your fingers here.
No. No! Are you sure?	I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
Who eats eight protein bars?	People who don't trust egg whites.
Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.	Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
What? No, she didn't say that.	You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, "What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him." And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
And it didn't change your mind.	You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
Michael, that's awful.	No, hmmm... that's still...
'Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?	Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it
I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.	Toby, come on.
That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.	Ready, one bullet. And boom!
After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.	I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. Let's see what she gets. Aah!
What about an energy drink or something?	Leave, get outta here.
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.	Right now!
Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?	Michael, nice tie or something.
Nobody better try to stop me. Good.	No.
No.	I could have stopped him.
Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.	Are you warmed up?
Are you warmed up?	Alleged contract.
Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.	God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?	Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
What did you do to yourself?	So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse?
So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point "B", uh... the beet juice cleanse?	Never mind. Just never mind.
Well, it better work.	How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.	Oh, it'll work. Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
[driving in car	Eughh.
Same page. Go to the next one.	Same page. Just keep moving.
Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix--	Which we can't know.
This is essentially...	Unless we're unplugged.
Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.	And wake up in the future.
Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.	What?
So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000.	What?
What?	I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.	$30,000? There's gotta be another way.
He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.	Look, I will not pay.
Well, I have an alternative.	"Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?"
Look, I don't think that's actually legal.	Agreed.
Agreed.	Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.	But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.	Fine. Five times.
I want eye contact.	No.
Yes.	Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Please.	Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
Hey Dwight.	Hey, IT guy.
Mind if I get in there for a second?	Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
Just one... Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell?	Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.	You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
Okay Dwight.	Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... You should fire the following people.
Well, I'm inclined to believe you.	Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money?	Are you referring to alchemy?
I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy.	I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
Okay. You can count on me.	Let me give you a hand.
I'm hungry.	Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them
The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office.	Basement office? You mean like a lair?
I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms.	Okay.
What time works for you? Mr. Schrute, what time works?	Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?	All right. Sounds good.
Well, I think that the real question is	Oh, just...
You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name?	Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and p0rn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. You were playing too.	I'm about to buy this building, you know.
You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.	Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
Streamers!	Hiya! Ha!
Hey. What are you doing?	From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
Well, what if you're cold?	Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people. Oh, you did hear.	Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably. Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.	Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.
Wow, that's a lot of keys.	The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.	Where?
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these.	Give me that.
Yep. Wait, and this.	Yes.
What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.	Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.
Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.	Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?
Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.	How close?
Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?	Yes. Of course.
Dwight is about to get so Pammed.	Hey, did you SMS text message me?
Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.	Okay, that's weird. Just hitting "door closed." What?
There we go.	Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.
Let's just calm down.	Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.
I don't-	Use your talons! Pry 'em open!
Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!	Well, don't look, freak!
Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!	I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!
Great.	How ya doin'?
The alternative is termination.	Wow. Late every day this week.
We had a safety concern. Um... we very politely indicated that he'd be welcome back...	Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?
Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?	Good Morning!
If he were in accordance with our dress policy.	Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.
Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.	What?
What?	Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.
Aaah!	It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
I'm very sorry.	You remember my cousin Mose.
You remember my cousin Mose.	Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
Were you painting in the dark?	You made a big mistake. Huge!
There it is. Alright.	Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?	Aaah!
Yeah.	I'll take the wizard!
I'll take the wizard!	Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. I see you found out magical toy box Jim.
You forged them! You forged the forms!	Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.
Yes.	Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.
Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.	We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.
You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet... "I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!" Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!	No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.
Prove it.	What?
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.	Oh no, no, no.
But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.	I promise you, that door locks!
So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.	Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!
The mall itself or just the stores in the mall?	All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!
Did something happen Dwight?	Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.
Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.	You don't want to know.
Dwight?	What?
Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the "F" word?	Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.
No you will not.	Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're "appearance"ists!
Ok.	You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
So what happened?	I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.	Ok
Yes, I will. I will talk alright. Be careful what you wish for Toby.	Apparently there is a famous Hollywood movie from the 1980's, Beautiful Girl...
Pretty Woman.	Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this s*x worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
No, no. I want to hear you tell it.	Ok, Um... The s*x worker is denied service at a fancy store because she does not look wealthy. She later returns dressed in all the "trappings" of extravagant wealth, but instead of going...
Agreed.	Really?
Maybe something not so monochromatic. Not so matching.	Wait. Less matching to appear more rich?
Yeah, I liked them too.	I can't see.
Say stuff like, "Good morning, Good Afternoon". People appreciate that.	Wait, I see you every day. Can I say "Good month?"
Please and thank you go a long way.	Copy. Thank you.
Thank you.	Please.
Wish us luck!	Thank you.
nan	What?
My place tonight. Wear this.	Do you have your card?
Is that what you were here for? A crystal wizard? I like it.	It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal.
Wait a second. You know you can't buy that now, right? And I can come back and get it for you later. But I'm saying right now, we can't do that.	Because I'm here for one thing. Revenge.
Let me know if I can help you with anything.	Excuse me sir.
Yes?	I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
I remember, yes. I'm terribly sorry about that.	You work on commission, don't you?
Dwight?	Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
Listen, I would like you to take me to Andy's play tonight.	Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.
Please, waste of time. You know what? Let's just knock this out right now. Disrobe.	Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.
Angela? Don't like her anymore. Not attracted to her anymore. Just contractually obligated to make a baby with her.	Give me the punch card.
No. If you want to punch the punch card, you have to take me to the show.	That is not in the contract.
Well, there's a lot of gray area in that clause. Do you want to re-mediate?	Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
Ooooh!	I work with that guy.
Ugh! There's gum on the seat and now it's on my work skirt. I have to go change.	Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss.
Oh, Dwight, just move.	His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
Come on, Dwight.	Why are you dressed like a seed catalogue model?
These are just my dirty old gardening clothes. They were all that I had in my car.	Let's go.
That was more horrifying than Nunsense.	All that singing got in the way of some perfectly good murders.
Okay.	All right, let's do this.
No, actually, Dwight, I didn't realize how far this walk was, and I-I'm exhausted.	It's okay, I smell.
No, no, no, no. I think I just want to go home, but it's okay. This can count as one of your times.	No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have s*x.
Well, I won't tell if you don't.	I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you... Ok. Oh, was that in the way? Get rid of it.
Good night, Dwight.	Good night.
No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.	Hola, hola. Necesito une bueno worker. Tu esporte! Come on! Que? QUE?
What did you think we were?	I pick up day laborers and tell them they'll get paid at six p.m. At five forty five, a certain INS agent by the name of Mose Schrute throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
I think for you to have come here even expecting that we can have a conversation like this show's ho-how self deluded you are! Michael, your memory has failed you greatly.	Hola, tu es une buena worker?
Si, yo muy bueno worker.	Michael!
Michael!	Y el accento, donde are you from?
Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.	You speak English?
Carroll, how are you?	Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.	nan
No.	That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
Weird...	Poor hornet.
Yeah.	I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.	He'll die.
I asked you if it was ok if I asked her out. You said, and I quote, 'My good sir! Nothing would make me happier than to hand you the hand of the hand once in my hand.' I specifically remember it because you said it in such a weird way.	When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
It's a family room.	Interesting choice...
What? Did you have that while we were together?	A bat! Impressive...
What? No! Wait, no. Definitely not cancer.	Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
No! It was like four years ago!	It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Can we please talk about how gross Meredith is?	I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had s*x with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
You know what guys, why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat. Ok? I was an REA in college and I can tell you, number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance.	Fence with a hole in it..
I don't even wanna know these things!	The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
How did this happen, how did I get this?	The democratic primaries,
The democratic primaries,	Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch. It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.	What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.	You may have...
Oh my God! What if I did?	You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.	You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
There's no way I'm gonna do that.	Then I will.
nan	No, I'm no doctor, but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease, inform them of it, and take overwhelming revenge on that person. Again, I'm no doctor. I'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge.
Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!	So long Donna!
Michael...	He forgot to mention the herpes.
Yeah. Fry it up in a pan. Never never never let you forget... I love that commercial.	I don't understand the reference.
Well, Michael, it was nice to get your call.	We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you.
Would you excuse us...	Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
Ok, unplanned pregnancy, going in the pros column.	Next stop is Helene. You're gonna wanna make a left on Willow, which is a little ways away, uh. I'll remind you.
You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...	Jan knows paper.
No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.	Wait, what Holly said?
Yes, I don't...	Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
I know, I know.	Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
Got it.	TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?	Come on old lady. Let's go.
What is happening?	Come on.
Look at that.	Then make him pitch to you.
Nice!	We gotta see what he's got.
Okay.	Okay, and remember-you're not gay.
Stop it! It's gonna be great.	Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
No, Meredith, that's not his actual bicycle, but it is the same exact model he uses.	Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.
Danny, I feel a real connection to you, and I gotta get real, I'm-	Yeah!
Oh, my god!	Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-	How do I look?
Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.	Normal. Ugly.
I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.	Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
But from where?	We have a big meeting with the chief buyer for Frames Select, Steve Nash.
Okay, so you...set up this fake company, then you hired this homeless woman to impersonate an executive to spy on me so that you could copy my sales technique?	Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
Or...crazy.	And who is this "the" Steve Nash?
I'm gonna go.	No.
No? Nothin'?	No!
No!	No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?	Go tell her we're here. You're good with receptionists.
I know, I know.	Crap.
I'm very upset!	Danny Cordray is the worst.
More freedom.	The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!	Also, he slept with Pam.
It's hard to judge ourselves accurately, isn't it.	I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?
I'm gonna intimidate him. Okay?	Michael?
Yes.	Watch this.
Watch this.	Can I talk to you about something?
No, you may not.	So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest pen1s I have ever seen." And I said, "I know. That's why I brought you to the pen1s Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." Well, hello Danny!
So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest pen1s I have ever seen." And I said, "I know. That's why I brought you to the pen1s Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." Well, hello Danny!	It's about this very announcement you just made.
How are ya?	Michael-
We're not-	What are you doing?
Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. Don't leave. Don't let him.	Like hell you are.
You hired him?	He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
You are busy! We're in a meeting!	Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
You need the big guns, yes?	Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
Good-bye!	What'd he say? What did he say?
Oh, you know...funny. Your wife and I went on a few dates.	There he is.
Three of you guys for one sale.	You snubbed her.
Well, whatever works for ya. Anyway. All right.	Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too "meh" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup? We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
It's good to see you guys. Nice to meet you.	Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. So...you're gonna be workin' here?
He's ready for you.	Welcome aboard.
Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?	I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.	It's after 5
Showtime!	Pleasure.
I'll be your croak madame.	He's not kidding.
Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.	Oh.
Nice.	Jim talked too much.
No, I didn't.	Yes, you did.
Oh, my god!	I know how we can learn his tricks.
I know how we can learn his tricks.	What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.
Is that your office?	Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
Nope. Different movie.	The Sting. The Sting.
Meredith Van Helsing?	Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
Oh, no, no. No. Don't-	People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
Yeah, he is that good-looking.	He's very, very handsome.
I've never been a desk man. Always traveling on the road. Come on...why not, huh?	Oh...
Oh!	Oh, man!
What do you mean?	I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
Ohh. Dropping bombs, right? This really make you think, Michael?	So long, Stanley!
Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.	Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.
Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.	To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler. Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
Sorry I was a jerk.	You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach.	Lake Erie.
I don't know, they're both handsome.	Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.	He went to Gabe behind your back.
No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.	He went over your head to go behind your back.
What is taking someone from behind?	No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.
It was a good idea, though.	Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
This is an amazing prize. I mean, I don't even want to give Pam a compliment, because she's so blegh, but she did a good job. I really want that coupon book.	Garbage magnet. Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!
What the hell are they talking about?	Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?	Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.	I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.
Well, uh, there's a nice bistro coming up. We could pick up some Paninis for the road.	Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? 'Cause of the euro.
Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on.	Uh...
Hey, is there a problem, you guys?	NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
Why?	The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...
Stop the bus, okay?	Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.	Yes. I would welcome it.
Blah-di-blah!	The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.
Do you guys want me to take you home or go back to the church?	For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs. For all your paper and printer needs.
Thank you. Anyone else with a prayer or a remembrance?	Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
Try "Jesus."	Opus dei.
Hello.	Shh, shh, shh.
It's gonna be three months of hard work and when we're done, we'll practically be Quimixtanos.	Greg, hello, it's Dwight from the vestibule. You want to know my eleventh commandment? I will not be undersold.
Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.	I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Are you kidding me? Stop it.	I'll call you back.
Tell them that I'm in a meeting.	Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
No, you may not.	Gah!
You know, there are a lot of guys out there who would just love and appreciate a-	They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Are you going?	Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
I would watch that.	Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
Better men than Gabe have tried to be my boss. David got fired. Charles got fired. Jan went crazy. Ed Truck, who I liked, got decapitated.	Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
Maybe I should go.	Kelly. Kev- Are you gonna quiet that baby? Or do I have to? In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
If I could get her sleeping normally I could get my life back.	That would be nice wouldn't it?
I can't even talk about it.	You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
I kind of doubt Gabe has suit.	Really? Oh... Then here we are.
I don't know about, love...	She loves me.
Outside my car in two minutes.	Well something's come up, I have to go.
No no no no no! She'll wake up!	I have something to do.
Look, I know what you have to do, please stay with Cece. Dwight? I've always considered for us to be very good friends. Great friends! Remember your concussion?	I do. But you married my worst enemy.
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-	Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
Absolutely!	From Jim.
What kind of pizza would you like?	Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
No!	Insert it in my mouth.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.	No, try me.
Jim, just don't think of it as degrading. Think of it as, you happen to be moving the six inches his way and he happens to be biting it.	I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
Okay...	No. Crust first. Okay, now the beer. Beer me Jim. Ssss. Gentle. Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
What no, wait! You said you were gonna help us!	I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
You need to stop talking.	Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. s*x contracts exist!
Okay fine! There must be some way to get out of it. Even just for tonight!	Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
Okay...	You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
No no no, don't. I will go talk to Angela.	She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
The reverse cycling ends tonight!	A single piece of pepperoni please.
I'm not gonna-	What are you doing?
Are you authorized to do this?	Uh-Oh. Okay, okay, nobody panic. Listen Up, listen up. Everyone, follow me to the shelter. We've got enough food for 14 days. After that, we have a difficult conversation.
Michael, how's it going, bro?	Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
Hey, thanks so much for having my back out there.	Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
Tonight?	Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z".
Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.	All Right
Wow.	And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. And let's hear it for... Purebred. Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King!
And now, by show of applause, We will crown this year's hay king. All in favor of Purebred. Put your hands together for... Mixed Bread. And let's hear it for... Purebred. Mm. It appears we have a three-way tie. I have no choice but to pick the Hay King myself. I pick... Me! I am your Hay King! All Hail your Hay King!	Yes.
Yes.	Did I truck 300 bales of hay to a parking lot to rectify some childhood disappointment? Yes.
I love it.	Angela? Angela!
Awesome.	Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.
Ah, this is good hay. Yeah. This is the good stuff, mattress quality.	Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! Watch it, watch it.
Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on! Watch it, watch it.	Hello! Welcome to Hay Place! A place for hay.
Don't forget to make a broom.	Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2
Hey, I'm kind of in the mood for a roll in the hay.	Roll in the hay, five dollars.
No, I meant...	Oh, our contract.
Mm-Hmm.	Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot. Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil.
Perfect!	So, uh... Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
Okay, all right. I know what you wanna see. I'll be right back.	Hey kids, was that fun?
Yeah!	All Right!
I wanna go on it again.	Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks.
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks.	Wow! This brings back memories. Hay stacking, hay throwing... and at the end of it all, one lucky boy would be crowned Hay King. I always wanted to be Hay King. The world shines on Mose.
Where have you been?! I've been waiting.	Uh, can we move this to the end of the day?
I found the needle in the haystack!	Hey, congratulations! Do you know what your prize is?
I don't know!	Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
Hey, Jim? Are you distracting these people?	nan
nan	Hey Pam.
Yeah?	Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes.
Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot. Okay. Here we go. Ah, yes.	Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
I know, because you're the reason we're moving.	I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.	Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
Uhh, I think it's something like umm...	D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.	What's the exact square footage.
Umm, let me see.	nan
nan	How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.	Uhh, aah!
Uhh, aah!	You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say "Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is." I can't wait.
Mmhmm.	nan
Fail. I don't want to fail... again.	Owning a building is a war between the landlord and the tenant. Not a literal war, unfortunately, but I am using the same tactics. I've surrounded the enemy, and I'm slowly starving them. To save on electricity I've installed a timer and motion sensors on the lights. It's part of my green initiative. And by green, I mean money.
I wasn't here.	China is on the move?
There was a time when the only people who texted you were people you wanted to text you. Girls. And they'd all say the same thing. "I'm coming over baby." And I would text back "BTB", bring that booty.	Impossible, I love the law.
Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.	I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.	I see I've underestimated you, and I didn't think that was possible. Nate, reply the paper.
Don't tell me how to do my business.	Reply it!
Reply it!	Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
Yeah, I figured that.	"Which is you" is not a sentence.
This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.	Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
Here we are.	Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
Raise your cups on high. Case closed.	Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
Hey Pam, Dwight's being questioned by the police in connection with a string of dog-nappings that ha...	They say the best vampires don't bleed their victims dry, but give them the strength so that they can bounce back only to be fed on again. I spared Pam, and I may feast off of her profits for years to come. I let Pam win. Haha, oh. I was not motivated by compassion. I have no compassion. Make sure you got that. Not motivated by compassion.
Come to parking lot. Crazy pigeon action?	You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity.
I don't know what the that was.	I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
Dwight take it down.	nan
I'm serious, take it down or else.	Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
I went out to look for a better office space.	Waste of time.
Yup.	Let me see.
Yeah, yeah. Totally.	You can't just move out.
Oh, its on.	In your perfect would, what would make this building awesome? I'm putting together kind of a wish list.
Well, I wish for a million wishes.	Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
Then see you later building.	You can't possibly be serious.
I'm pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California." What?	Parley, my office, five minutes.
I understand it, I can't speak it.	Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.
You've been watering down the soap?	Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
We need everything back the way it was.	You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous... for stripping.
Ten thousand seven hundred and six.	Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
Yeah.	There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
The building's underground?	She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...
Pam. Pam?	What?
I'm Pam.	Oh.
No you're not.	I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.
Oh, that's fine.	So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?
I've been known to bend the truth.	Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.
Okay.	I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
Zip it, Meredith.	I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
Hey, who's in charge of making drinks around here? Is there a bartender?	You are?
I'll make it. What are you drinking.	Let me see you jump. Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.	I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?	You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
I just, no, she be talking to your mom or something. This is my daughter too, Justine! You seem to think, oh... pick a damn tree already.	I'll take that as a no.
This is a fast food receipt from April.	Oh come on.
He smells awful.	Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
Great.	Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
Hey.	Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Merry Christmas.	You apologize to me right now.
What do you say?	You apologize right now.
Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?	Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
A trampoline...	No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. Jim, let go. Let go.
We went to a picnic thrown by the Comptroller's wife.	nan
Well...	Oh, no. Oh, no!
Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...	Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.	Huh? You like that?
I'm sorry. I had no idea.	Pam?
Pam?	Huh?
Hi guys.	Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.
Okay.	In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.
We need to know who Jimmy Halpert was before he was bitten by the bear. Otherwise, it's the bear's quest.	Death to Toby!
There's this female uh, uh, stenographer at the courthouse...	Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a s*x slave?
What? What?	I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
Hold on, Holly's coming back here?	With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?	Wait, what girlfriend?
She's one sassy black lady.	I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
I do. She is.	Okay.
Well, then he's not a senator.	Dear God in heaven.
Hey.	Okay, hey, hey, hey...
Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?	Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
Oh, God, you look great.	You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave...
Oh... when did you get here?	Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Hey	Ahh!
Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.	nan
Pleased to see you. Thank you.	I have no feeling in my fingers or pen1s. But I think it was worth it.
Good trip down?	Haahh!!
What's up?	Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Oh, no, Michael, I don't want to talk about it with you. I mean, I'm fine, I just... I don't want to talk about it.	This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.	Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels. One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.
And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.	No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
It was insensitive and I am sorry.	What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? Dwight, don't be bothered by the. Over the line, Jim.
I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.	Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.	Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.
Well, I am.	And the rest was juststuff.
I'm going to help you.	Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
I said no hits!	It was pretty awesome.
Yeah, just a little, I have a lot to deal with today.	Wow. Did your baby draw that?
Both sad.	Gentlemen.
I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael.	Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
Shaaa-shut up. Hello.	Yeah!
Do you want to keep this?	Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
Hey, Dwight, I'm collecting resolution cards.	Not doing that.
Why not?	I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
Ugh.	Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that... My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
That's a good one.	Yeah.
You know what, that's my new one. I'm taking that one, too.	Awesome.
The bookstore?	It's that easy?
I'll come with you, show you how it's done.	Okay, I'll drive.
All right! We should divide up by section. I will take romance and travel.	I'll take the entirety of the second floor.
Hi.	Welcome.
Why did we pretend like we work here?	Is that what we were doing?
Good!	Good. Real good.
Really?	Yeah, yeah!
We kinda nailed it.	Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
Cool.	Okay. What'd you get?
A book about oceans.	Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
Whoa! Hold on.	I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Oh, no, no, no. Uh-uh.	Come on, why not? I've never been in one before. I'm tired of being Mr. Perfect Role Model all the time.
I'm telling you, don't do it. I've got nothing against strip clubs, but I do have something against them at noon on a Monday. The day shift at a strip club? You can't unsee that.	Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
I don't know. Single moms at a skating party. Sweet sixteen, ten year reunion parties.	Chicks fall down, need help getting back up.
All right.	Andy. I didn't think you had it in ya.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office.	Hey.
Hey.	How are the marks?
How are the marks?	What are some of your small business ideas?
Oooh!	That's great. There's a big, big future in that.
A lot of mines in Scranton.	Um, what about you?
Uh, credit cards.	Uh-huh.
My company would act as an intermedium, for like, point two cents off every transaction.	Wow!
Something with cell phones. It's like, every time you make a phone call I'd make point two cents. Or anything like any on-line shopping I would get point two cents.	Right. Okay? Great.
Great.	You promised us whales. These are worms.
What? I already lost Jim. Salesmen are suppose to help each other out. We're suppose to be a team.	We're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team.
It is hard to explain why Erin is doing so well today. The only thing I can think is Erin is living out some "Slumdog Millionaire" scenario, where every word she's playing has a connection to her orphan past. It's possible.	So what's your crazy business pipe dream?
Well, I started my own golf supply company.	Really?
It's taken off faster than I expected, so I came here to learn about creating manageable growth.	Phyllis?
Hmm?	Some of these people are for real.
Some of these people are for real.	Hey, friend. How's it going? Oh, you know what? Let me steep that for you.
Thank you.	Hey, you know what? Good news. We're back in. Let's go sell some paper, Buddy. Huh?
Excuse me.	I got it. I got it.
Hi. Hope you enjoyed your lunch. Welcome back. Ooh. Well, hello. Welcome to the seminar. Hey, man. What's goin' on?	You're gonna blow it.
I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?	Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, "this way, this way"?
Sure we do.	Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.	All right then. Someone propose a plan.
Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.	Not you, Erin.
Yes I do.	That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.
No, you can have your own opinion.	Right. I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination. Maybe he's bowling.
It's kind of a sketchy neighborhood though. I better come along.	Problem solved everyone. Space Orphan and Princess Nincompoop are off to rescue Michael. Unbelievable. I'm going. You drive, I got a car full of fox meat.
I can't wait.	Male. Caucasian. Forties. Black hair. Facial type
Which way did he go?	Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way.
She's right. He went that way.	Alright. Don't get a swelled head. You're no tracker. Let's ride.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.	Has Michael checked in?
Oh, hey Dwight.	I asked you a question.
No, he hasn't.	Goodbye.
No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...	Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.
No.	This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...	Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.
Ok, well it wasn't obvious so...	No word from Michael.
Okay. You've just lost my business.	Hey.
Hey, you were in there forever.	There's too many brands. Where's Holly?
She wandered off like an idiot.	Hey!
Hey.	What are you doing?
You know what? Say hi to Orville Tootenbacher for me.	Tootenbacher.
farts popcorn.	Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?
Well, I think I can get through the door.	Excuse me Do you speak English? We are looking for a man. Michael, this tall, black hair, Caucasian...
What? No. Dwight asked if I wanted an egg roll. What... what are you implying?	Uncanny. Put a pin in that. Which way did he go? That guy! When he leave here, which way did he go? We looking for him. This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
I think he was heading downtown.	He's heading downtown.
There you go. Thanks.	Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.
Big tip.	Shh.
What?	Just hush.
We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.	Just rock. Shh.
Shh.	Movie idea?
Um, bottomless champagne.	Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.
No.	Kevin! Do more stupid faces.
What's up?	I don't know.
Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.	Do the monkey face!
But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...	Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.
Well, okay then.	Go back to the monkey!
At least until Stanley calms down.	Hurl your feces.
D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku.	Good.
All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you.	They really do that.
They really do that.	Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really.
B-9.	You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.
Sit. Okay, just close your eyes.	My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.
I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.	Michael. Confession
Thank you.	I've had intercourse in the office.
All right.	As has Angela!
Dwight!	As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. As has Michael and as has Holly.
Just leave it how you said...	Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?
Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?	And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
Pro.	Yes!
Master Scarn.	I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- to be like this! But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
Tell him I'm retired.	It's Goldenface.
Oh-	He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
Oh yeah! Yes he is!	No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
Ahhhh, yeah! Threat Level Midnight! Makes all the girlies feel alright! From Madonna to Madelyn Allbrite, Threat Level Midnight! It's a threat, a level, a level level threat. He's the greatest hockey-star I ever seen yet. Threat Level what? Midnight! Threat Level who? Michael Scarn! Threat Level why? Apartheid! Gotta fight it, Free Mandela! Peace I'm out!	I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
Okay, go back to the annex.	They're still good for another week.
Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.	Hardy har har. Okay picture this
That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-	No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!	Could be.
No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.	I can see that happening, yes.
That's probably good. That's enough.	That's a realistic time line.
Let's not go crazy.	Perhaps.
Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool.	I can see that as a very real possibility.
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!	I can see that happening.
I can see that happening.	And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.	Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!	Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!	He took my desk.
After you!	It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.	No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse.	Why's he talking to Holly?
I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local talent.	Holly, you approved this?
Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.	I didn't order anything.
Three.	Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.	I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.	No it is not.
Check it out!	I don't wanna move desks!
Don't even watch, Halpert!	Hey, who's dirt box is this?
Oh, that's our Zen garden.	What do you grow in here, bullcrap?
He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.	Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
nan	Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
Why?	'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
That's a lot of reasons!	Drink it!
So, this hot chocolate thing.	None of your business.
Well, you know you can't actually poison him.	It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
I really think we should join forces on this one.	Really.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.	I know.
Here we go.	Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.	Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.	Who is Justice Beaver?
He... It's a crime fighting beaver.	Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.	Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve.	There are over four hundred of these!
Yeah I couldn't cut it down.	They're all good. So good! Number three
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?	Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Michael..	People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
In-grown hair.	It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Mh hmm.	The warmth will lure people inside.
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!	This is how business...
And over here..	I'm not closing the door.
Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do.	Stop it.
Let's go in here.	Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.	Not so fast.
Holly, will you marry me?	Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
No.	I will trade you for the used candle.
No.	Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
Will you marry me?	That's how it's done.
Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.	Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
Screw you man. People like my stuff.	People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
You can take my Helen Fielding collection.	And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
Sure.	What is this?
How did those get out? I'm sorry.	Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.	That's a common swindlers trick.
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.	So you wanna sell me magic beans.
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.	Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.	You got this kosher certified?
No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.	Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects.
Thank you. Whatcha got there?	Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.	things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.	Jim, put those away.
I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.	just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
Nice.	I know right... what the?
Oh my God.	That... that's impossible.
It is right. I mean, it's impossible.	All right, I'll take them.
They're probably worthless.	Probably.
Leave the telescope.	I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans. So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-	Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.	Thanks for meeting me.
Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.	There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
You know me very well, Dwight.	That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.	I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
I guess this is my life now.	How do I become a manger at Sabre?
First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.	I left a message at corporate.
Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.	Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
What recommendation?	From when he recommended me to replace him.
Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.	Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
Anything can happen at the Dundies! They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!	Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Black tie optional.	Every day is black tie optional!
So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. And that person is DeAngelo!	Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him.	nan
Hi!	Appalling. Eye sore. Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.	Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! Was that part of the...?
Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!	Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
Why?	Big smiles folks! There they are.
I can just run over to the gas station.	We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.	I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.	Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
What is your problem?!	I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.	And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
Ahhhh...	Michael?
Maybe neither.	I've got a treat for you!
Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.	Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
N-	That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! Hah!
Okay.	What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?	Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.	Great idea.
Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow.	Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!	Yes.
So I wanted to give you that. It's a letter of recommendation.	Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? You're like a giant walking salami!

You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? You're like a giant walking salami!	This is gonna be good. To whom it may concern. Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. The dictionary defines superlative as
Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?	nan
nan	Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.	nan
You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.	Uh oh...
Do you believe that?!	I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
There he is! Got ya coffee.	Oh, wow, thank you. That was so kind of you.
Not a coffee guy, I take it.	It's just that I own the coffee shop. So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
Listen. I've got a sixer. "Automatic for the People" on the jukebox. Let's hit the park after sundown. Come on! Pick up some sausage if you want.	I think you'll find what you're looking for over there.
You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name. So I've never had to buy it. True story. I just drink my cousin's.	Congratulations on your one cousin. I have seventy. Each one better than the last.
You know what... straight up, why don't you like me?	I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here. Okay? I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it. Okay?
Ohhhh no.	What?
Okay? I'm gonna win you over.	No you're not.
Yes I am.	No.
Oh yes.	No.
Yes.	No.
Yes.	No.
Yes.	No.
Yes.	No.
Dwight, what's your take?	What's the argument here? NBA, WNBA. One is a sport, one is a joke. I love sports, I love jokes. Room for all.
Yeah.	No!
Nope. Just... Okay.	So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Dwight? Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.	Really? Anything.
Do you need anything?	Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. Let's go downstairs! Okay? Let's do it.	Pass. If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
Damn it, Dwight! Enough! Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper!	Okay, a little about me. I respond to strong leadership.
Another one?	No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?	Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?
Thank you.	Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. Jordan, gather my things from my desk.
Amen.	Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
Ooh, about what?	That's on a need-to-know basis.
I thought I needed to know for your calendar.	General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?	Define foment.
You define foment.	Please take note of the new color-coding system.
Please take note of the new color-coding system.	Aha!
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?	Gotcha! Why are you late?
It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.	All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area.
No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.	Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.	You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.	Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in.	I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.	Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
And the desk.	The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
Okay.	Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...	Don't make me fire you.
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.	Don't make me pre-fire you.
You wouldn't dare.	Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.	What?
If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, "Well that's pretty premature to think," but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.	How you doing, Jordan?
I'm good.	Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
Why are you telling me this?	Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou- Ohh... it's a holster.
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou- Ohh... it's a holster.	Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. Ohh... Oh, what a day. What a day.
Dwight, are you carrying a gun?	The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.	The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
Why do you need to wear the holster at all?	Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
You could put your cell phone in it instead.	Uh... hello!
You could put a banana in it.	Why would I put a banana in my holster?
Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.	Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah!
Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.	No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.	Okay, why are you calling Jo?
I'm gonna keep trying Jo.	Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!	Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
We all saw you do it.	Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Navy blue. Little red anchors.	I have no way of knowing if that's true.
I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this?	Okay, really?
I felt terrorized.	Come on.
Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.	I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?	Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
Hey. We're back.	There he is! Our hero! You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.	Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.	American Idol? What? No.
Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?	No.
Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?	Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.	I put everything back in the vending machine.
You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.	Okay.
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.	Thank God.
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?	What's jazz hands?
nan	Fine.
Fine.	nan
Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers.	Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic.	Well, what can you do? Life.
And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.	Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.	No, Kevin, come on.
My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.	Kevin, not now.
Hey, Jo!	Okay, okay. Shh!
No, under the jacket.	You're kidding me. Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
I don't feel anything.	Oh, it's so wet.
Push harder, Dwight.	I can't. I can't push harder!
Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher.	Okay, how's that?
Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.	I'm kneading it!
Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?	Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
What?!	I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?	It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.	I take full responsibility.
Who else would be responsible?	Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
You shot a gun off -	Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.	Got it.
I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job.	Jo, please... I will -
Hey, Dwight. What's up?	Shut up.
I did.	Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
nan	Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.	Okay.
Don't even... EEEHHHH!!!!	It's complicated.
Okay.	They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!	Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.	Assistant Regional Manager.
That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?	Assistant Regional Manager.
Yes. You do.	Assistant Regional Manager.
Thank you.	Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... It's me. I'm Dwight.
Oh.	Yeah.
So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?	I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.	Yes.
It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.	What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? What are you doing..? Stop trying to figure me out.
'Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.	You can't.
How'd my girl Nellie do?	No, it's not.
She didn't mention it?	Stop trying to figure me out. Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
Integrity move. I like it.	Get out.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.	I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
Thank you.	Silence?
Augh.	Dwight Schrute.
So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?	You have to interview me...
Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.	I demand more questions!
Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.	Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
I didn't think you were.	What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? That's a great question. I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
How many windows are there in New York City?	Thank you. You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting.
Your department's just you, right?	Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
I suppose I am.	I want an interview.
Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. what do 'I' want?...	How's the family?
So now anyone gets to talk at any times?	Good. They good?
What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... Everyone is listening to me.	What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
Yes.	Peepa, how is she?
Okay.	Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?	What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Kelly's on your side.	Now, listen,...
Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.	Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-	I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited s*x breaks for you and Pam...
A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.	Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.	Ha ha!
I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.	Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
Hey! Hey! Hey!	Let me get that for you.
She may have a point there... would a small pen1s work? Small-to-moderate.	Okay.
Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.	We're gonna miss you, Gabe.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...	I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... I don't know. Something always works out.
After you my good sir.	No, I insist.
I can't get down.	K... Kevin!
K... Kevin!	Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great.

I am having a child with my husband, the Senator. And Pam is having a child with Jim... the great salesman.	Hoist him aloft. C'mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl.
Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?	Say no more.
Say no more.	Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. â€˜Specially with me around.
Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no?	What are you looking at?
It's, it's nothing.	It can't be nothing.
No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?	Nice catch.
Ahhh!	Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh.	... 2, 3!
Thanks guys.	Okay, which side of the list am I on?
Left.	Yes!
Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.	This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here's something. Who would eat who in an â€˜Alive' situation. No... that can't be it.
â€˜Scuse me?	Shhh, Pam. C'mon, don't be such a right-sider.
No.	No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here and left side of the list... ATTACK!
I'd like to invite the following people to join me for lunch	That's great. Let's do this guys.
That's regular pizza.	You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?
I just think you guys are winners and I wanted to have lunch with you.	Okay!
Well, what about the other guys.	Losers.
No.	C'mon.
I don't- I don't wanna say-	C'mon, c'mon.
No, no.	C'mon.
Ha, I guess I think they're losers.	Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
Yeah?	Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it's over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word "no" not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.	Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
Good night Andy.	Good night.
This is where I grin and be-YOW OW!	This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet....the Pyramid.
Invest in softer cotton, sir. OW! Oh! Oooh! oh, whoa!!	So, you can tell your clients
So, you can tell your clients	Obviously you can go the ass tattoo route and obviously, I'm gonna like it.
It's huge. How much does it weigh?	DRAW SOME BLOOD!
DRAW SOME BLOOD!	Oh no no no. Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, it's barely three pounds.
Why did I choose Andy to run the office? Because he's all surface, uncomplicated. What you see is what you get. Could be a recipe for mediocrity, yes, but then again, it might just be why people fight for him.	Fifty L.
There's something about an underdog that really inspires...the unexceptional.	You're really going to want the booster.
Maybe.	Thank you.
I already did.	Is this really the best use of our collective time?
Fine.	OK, let's look at some ties.
Fine.	Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise.
Here's how I'm going to help out from now on. I'm going to not care, and I'm going to sit around quietly waiting for Andy's inevitable demise.	Your friend Neil Patrick Harris really made me laugh the other night.
Dwight, anything?	We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house.
D-Bone. There you are.	Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie...? Lick the spoon?
No, that's ok. Just, I want, I wanted to ask you about...	Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just don't see the point. It's so Wall Street.
I know, right?	Right?
Yeah...um, how is everything?	Good. Really really good.
Must be a tough time to be a family farm.	Oh, it is. And beets are not immune. We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
Oof. What are you gonna do about that?	I don't know, what do you mean?
There's gotta be some way you can double your beet sales...	You wanted the job, the job is yours. Just do the job! And I'll do mine..... walnuts?
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that case...let's get to work.	Yeah!
So, coming out of his butt is a...	....back orders and you never called them.
Well, we don't know how long the driver's been gone and it's not in direct sunlight.	Uh, it's not totally empty.
Here, I'm gonna get in my car. When I start dying, I will honk the horn three times. That means save the dog.	OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.	OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy. Come on.
OK Darryl, listen and then you will understand. The boxes were ruined during our first trial testing so now it's cool cause we found another use for them.	There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
Hey, hey, hey. Vick did his time.	I don't know.
No Jim, tell 'em what a name is.	Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey!
Jim, he's not gonna star-	OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
Shh! Shh! Stay there, stay.	It's uh, it's in beta testing.
It's uh, it's in beta testing.	Nein. Sits. Goot.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?	Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.
Yeah, I lost my client.	Yeah, that'll work.
We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.	Bye poochie!
Oh..	Before taxes.
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.	I know what you'd do with all that money. "Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug."
No..we don't	I think we'll be fine.
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...	Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god. False. Andy, I will volunteer.
OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.	Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it!
Damn!	Yup.
Alright.	What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband.
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.	Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
Yeah Not that they're not smart people.	No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
I'd go with that.	Like baboons or elephants.
Yeah we move stuff and it was fun.	Kevin! Doesn't apply.
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now.	Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?
So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.	Message in a Bottle, The Postman...
Kevin Costner.	Kevin Costner.
So, it's not the dumbest idea.	It's not the greatest one either...
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.	And it's clear we're not going to carry them.
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.	Exactly.
Is he OK?	Yep. He'll be fine.
Okay, don't be gross.	What's going on?
Somebody defaced the billboards we just put out in an inappropriate way.	Oh, that's funny. Wait, from the photo shoot with you and me?
Yeah, Dwight.	No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOO!
No. No. No! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! No, no, no, no, no, no, No, No, No, NO, NO! NO! NO! NO! NOOOOOOOOO!	Schrute Farms is very easy to find, it's right in the middle of the root vegetable district. If the soil starts to get acidic, you've probably gone too far.
Just give us the address. We'll look it up online.	It's simpler this way.
See you all there at 3 p.m., Connecticut Casual, remember your manners, and have a wonderful time.	And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
So, we've typed in the address, now let's take a look at the street view.	They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?	There's so much more to it than that.
There's so much more to it than that.	I've been wanting Schrute Farms to break into the high-end event hosting industry for some time, and this party is a great opportunity. Plus, I've got a secret weapon. Only one copy in the world and some sucker on the internet sold it to me for two dollars.
It's a little tricky, you might have to... take...	MR. RYAN HOWARD!
Chapter 2 â€“ Announcing guests as they enter is the height of decorum. The more volume displayed, the more honor is bestowed upon everyone present.	STANLEY HUDSON AND HIS MISTRESS CYNTHIA! JAMES, PAMELA, AND PEEPEE HALPERT!
Wow.	MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
I understand.	Set that down. Present yourself.
Chapter 4 â€“ One of the host's most important duties is as Dance Master. A proper courtly dance sets the tone for the entire afternoon.	LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY I PRESENT, ROBERT CALIFORNIA!
I think we should toast...	Ladies and gentlemen! The last supper.
That's because you didn't bring a jacket.	My first love is beet farming, but it's a young man's game. Who ever heard of an old beet farmer?
Forget the beets. Concentrate on the hosting. I could spend a considerable amount of money having my birthday party here.	Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking?
Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me?	I can get you exotic meats â€“ hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
We'll talk.	It'll all be goat.
I think I left my wallet in your house.	Who cares.
Right here.	MR. JAMES HALPERT!
Keys, keys...	Stop forgetting things.
I didn't forget them, they're right here.	MR. JAMES HALPERT!
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...	What? Idiot.
Whoo.	MIS... MI... What are you doing?
Hey, I have a question. Who do you think is really the best salesman in this office?	That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
Oh my god, what the hell is wrong with you?	It's called a costume.
What are you, some kind of Jamaican zombie woman?	Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
Whoopi Goldberg.	Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
Very low pressure in the Sargasso Sea, warm air from South America, cold air from Greenland. All signs point to the perfect storm.	Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
What are you, anyway?	I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
If you had some really big wings with blades on the end, you'd kind of look like Kerrigan from Starcraft.	Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
If you're going to be a Zerg, at least be a Lurker, not some girl.	Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
Yeah, she also has boobs.	Yeah, but no nipples.
Mmhmm. Dwight are you eating a stick?	It's a root you idiot.
Everyone hates you.	That's really rude. I don't tell you hurricanes suck even though it's true.
What do you like? Tornadoes?	Try influenza.
Oh yeah? What's the vaccine you can take to avoid a hurricane?	Open up a newspaper. Oh look a hurricane's coming. I suppose you're going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
Are you serious?	Yeah I'm serious.
That's funny. Ok.	Loser.
Thank you.	Go, get up there right now.
Dwight?	You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.
Dwight.	Nice.
Dwight!	Got 'em. Go!
Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here.	Don't say cow- Ugh.
Closing time, time for you to go home to the places you will be from.	Sive drafely.
Whoa, no, wait, wait, wait, whoa.	Sorry, go ahead.
Awww, sorry. Did it break?	Wha...Yes. Your attention. Uh because... No that is all.
Nah, it's good.	Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted "We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.
Is that off again?	They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?
Yeah. That does not feel good.	I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.
What do you got?	Allow me. You're going to love this. Ugh...should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
Sounds controversial.	Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.	Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
Go do the voodoo that you do so well.	I will do my voodoo.
And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call...Dwight...	The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.	Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
What emails are you talking about?	Robert's favorite songs
That's not that bad actually.	P.S. We should should kill him.
Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?	No, it's an accountability booster.
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.	Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
We can't do this Dwight.	Smile...nod. Smile and nod.
Smile...nod. Smile and nod.	They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like...not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor...
Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.	But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
There's an easy way to tell if this device is a sham. We just make a mistake. I'll send an order down to shipping before we've received payment.	Oh, there's one mistake.
Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I...	It's not a doomsday device, gosh. We can do this you guys.
Alright everybody, you are doing great!	Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work.
Dwight, question.	No questions.
If this doomsday device goes off...	Accountability booster.
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?	I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
Ok.	How about Scrantonstrangler666.
Nope.	No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha...You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
Dwight we got five strikes.	Really?
Did the email go out or...	It goes out automatically at five P.M.
Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.	Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.	No.
What?!	You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
We did our best.	No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. What?!
You're a real crumb bum, you know that?	Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
Uh, the man tree puts its penis-	Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
Nn no.	What?
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut down the machine!!! Shut it down! Shut it down!	Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
I'll try both.	Oh. Come to reason with me?
Gotcha something. And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-	Get lost.
What are you doing?	What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
Yeah, do you need a hand?	If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
Where you going?	In. I'm hungry.
Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.	Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.	This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?	Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's "Nobody's perfect." Nice stroke, Pam.
No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.	I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.	Any specific animal?
Who's calling?	She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.
You're not going to take it?	And she called it nuts?
Yeah.	Come on.
I'm sorry â€“ I'm with a very important client. It'll have to wait.	Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my pen1s. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
Oh my God.	Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
She's not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.	We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.
You have to share the machine with others.	Andy I'm really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
Andy I'm really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.	Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
Line 2.	Jim, are you serious?
That stuff can come back to get you. It's called karma. You do not want to be messing around. I got an uncle...	Okay, you're done.
Hey Cathy.	Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
How's it going? Everything make sense?	Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?
Great.	Yep, he's lying.
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?	Oh we know.
Oh we know.	I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
Hey â€“ asking for a friend. Do you happen to know if that new girl is single?	Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
Yeah me too.	Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.
What are you doing with my lunch?	It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
Yeah and we're not about to make love. I just thought maybe you'd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.	It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
So word on the street is she has a boyfriend.	Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
It's going to be nice to have just a healthy, young, fit presence in the middle of the office.	But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.
You know what would be the hottest thing ever? It's a pregnant Helen Mirren.	Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
In this case yes.	No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
No we're not.	Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That's right. You're fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good?	That's just absurd.
Yes, because she's hot, right?	Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
Dwight, am I hot right now?	Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
What about before? Was I attractive before?	Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.	You think Jim's lying? That's so cute. I know he's lying.
Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.	Done. I never touch a pregnant woman.
Yep, that's the Dwight I need.	If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
Okay.	Rule one
I think so. Okay.	Rule two
Well, what does that... is that... okay.	Rule three
Yep, good.	We're gonna bust this guy.
Honesty is very important to me.	So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
Well, you came to the right person. You have to follow your intuition, Pam. You don't want to end up like Elin Nordegren. Actually, what am I saying, you wish you had her life- no offense, Pam.	None taken. What do you got?
Yeah, but I do Pam, okay? It's called being a nice person.	I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
Jim's on to me.	Hmm?
Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.	Just ugly enough to have deniability.
Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.	Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.
No, Kelly, don't.	The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.
With the crotch?	With the crotch.
Whoo!	Psst. We're not here.
Who said that?	Exactly.
How'd I get this long triangle?	Okay, just shut it.
Is he puffing out his chest?	I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
No. Maybe he just said something funny.	Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
I think he's just making her laugh.	Time for me to find out.
Why's he making her laugh so much?	Just going to walk over here- whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to!
Are you okay?	I'm fine, I'm totally fine.
Dwight! Dwight!	Yes? Wha- Jim.
Sorry about that.	Aw, cramp, I'm just-
Dwight! Why?	I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
Leave.	Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft pen1s for nothing.
That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!	Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
Actually it is the northernmost.	Ha!
Ha!	The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.
I'm in too.	Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
Yeah, but I'm confused...	Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
Mm-hmm.	...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
Oh. D.P.A. sounds way more important that total deaths.	Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
Dwight, what are you telling this girl?	The truth.
Oscar, I am so glad you just got here. I would've believed everything he said.	No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
Interesting.	Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
Really? Why don't you tell us the real history, Gore Vidal?	Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
he's a historian.	Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
Yes, yes, yes!	Not by a long shot!
Yes!	No, it was not!
Argh!	No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
What?	Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
Erin-	Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
Oh, well, that's a great question. Actually some of the most-	Excuse me, I got a question for you.
Sure.	Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?
Uh, I haven't heard of that one.	Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
Alright fine. You know what â€“ I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would. I'm still going. And I'm not going to ask anymore. I'm not even going to look back. I'm just going to assume that you're with me.	You said you weren't going to look back.
Dwight â€“ this is one of the archivists here. I thought maybe we could consult him.	Really?
Yeah.	Well. Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
You've heard about it?	YES! Ha! Prepare to be refuted! Go on.
Dearest mother I'm sorry it has been so long since my last letter. It is three months since I arrived at Schrute Farms and I fear I may never leave this place alive. Melvin Fifer Garris.	Hallowed ground.
Wow. This is so much better than the story you made up.	I've seen enough.
Abe and Mary are seated watching the show. Oh Mary this is wonderful... Ok Mary stop your scolding. I'll be quiet. I need her like I need a hole in the head! BANG! Ooh	Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.
Answer the question, please.	Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.
I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.	Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a suicide cult.
Yes. All right. Great.	Oh yeah?
Yep.	That's right Jim.
Heh.	Hey.
Hey, Mrs. California.	No. Putting a load on more like it.
You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.	Last thing I need is luck.
Yeah, I thought we really hit it off.	Thank you so much.
Well, different circumstances.	What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Who knows?	Oh that's real creative.
Maybe after all this settles down...	I could, but I just don't feel like it loser.
It's a date.	Standing.
Ok.	You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?
You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?	Don't!
Because you're sitting?	Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!	Standing.
You know I have to do this.	All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?	I know.
Andrew... Baines... Bernard.	No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it's like taking a test, but I know the answers.	What do you want!?!
What was that?	Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
Alright.	Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.
You don't have to say it if you're doing it.	Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Uh weight lifting yeah.	Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
I'll take a look.	Your path from obesity begins right here!
I've been meaning to join a gym. For my health. I used to say I wanted to live long enough to see a black President. I didn't realize how easy that would be. So now I want to live long enough to see a really, really gay President. Or a supermodel President. I want to see all the different kinds of Presidents.	Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.
Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.	Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.	It's the second easiest job in the world. Being a mom.
I love shopping and sales is just the other side of that.	That is true.
You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.	That's me.
Dwight why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.	Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale.
Oh how am I supposed to pull this off?. The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now.	Ready? What do you think?
Um no. This is not a gym. This is like a scene out of Saw 5.	You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month...
Obviously you know how a gym works. So you know I'm not going to pay money for this. You want people to come to your gym? Make a real gym.	Darryl...
We promised we'd never say goodbye.	Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.
Enough Oscar, enough.	Kelly?
I have these new sneakers which are basically like a gym for your feet.	That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.
Got it.	What do you think you're doing?
Getting my sweat on.	I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
I just did, like, 35 minutes on the treadmill.	I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
No.	Eight minutes!
Dude, I'm gonna be here all week, right? Five days a week, I figure I'll start slow.	Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
It's Lejon Brames.	That's what I said.
You know, get it right.	I know.
Oh boy.	This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.
Yeah, I'm gonna ask questions and I might not do what you say.	First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
Okay, I'm not doing that.	Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
What? I haven't bar tended in forever. Oh, never considered myself a mixologist, oh this is daunting. Um, I need a mortar, pestle, muddler..does anyone have any chocolate shavings?	What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
And...	Where? Dark side or light side?
And you have any advice or anything?	Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
...Help me feel better...	Thank you, Andy.
What is all that?	Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
No I'm not, I'm gonna sell it on Ebay! No no no, you be careful. Be careful.	I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense.
Ow, What are you doing?	What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
Oh my god.	What is it?
Erin, it was great fun tonight. Take a few aspirin and a whole lot of water, sleep in in the morning.	No, absolutely not.
Sorry, hi, I hope you feel really welcome, we all want you here.	Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?
My ex is meeting my s*x....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your pen1s...that's just part of it.	Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.	Boom!
Maybe you should mind your own business. Just kidding!	Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!
Oh my god.	Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?	Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
No, no, no, no, no. Women chase him. He misses his wife.	Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
Nice try, this is ridiculous.	Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
Three times.	You see?
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...	Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.	Come down right away!
Uh, I don't know, let me ask. Uh, were you quilled?	Yes, I was quilled.
And what's it's name?	Henrietta.
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.	Enough of this garbage. This is Christmas. Hi-yah!!!!! Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
Aw!	Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!	You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.	Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.

So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.	Dwight Schrute for Robert California!
Oh, hello Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here. Can I get you anything at all?	I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
Dwight? What are you doing here?	Gabe? You don't know?
Course I know.	Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
Dwight.	Robert.
You made it.	Yes.
Impressive initiative. I don't know what's worse, the trip or the destination. Well, uh, let me settle in and I'll be with you shortly.	Very good.
You can reduce your prices by ten percent or we're going to be finding a new source for our morning bagels. All right.	Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
Yeah. But not just bagels. All unwanted problems. Question	Meat grinder.
Too slow. It's the toilet. And I am the toilet of this office. I flush away annoying problems so others can keep their hands clean. And, just like a toilet, I am essential.	You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
Dwight. Today is not my day at all, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be able to meet with you, but I'm leaving you in the very capable hands of our COO.	But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
CEO to COO. What a difference a letter makes.	Still an important position. Still a chief.
Hey man, uh, look. Unfortunately, Bill had to go fight a fire, so your appointment got-	There's no fires within eight miles of here.
Well, it's nine miles away. I'm going to be meeting with you on his behalf.	What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
Chill, man. This plan is airtight.	So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!
Well, you got my vote.	Oh my God.
I know.	Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
What?	What's with the smile?
You're doing great. You know, so good.	And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation. Put your hand on my hand. Flush! Ow!	Take me to Robert.
Ow! He went home.	Take me to his house.
Uh, it's a condo and it's long-term business housing.	You know where it is. Lead me there.
Ow! Ow! Stephanie, help!	Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.	Which one is it?
I don't know. All I know is the building.	Robert! Robert California! Robert!
They haven't really improved on the Oreo, have they?	No thank you.
Sit down, Dwight.	Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle
You were dining alone? All those people are you?	Yes, exactly. Riddle number two
Ah-ah-ah- your drive, your ambition. It would be wasted on a manager's job. And Florida, you don't want to live here. Even I don't want to live here. That's why I'm always at my place in Scranton. Florida is America's basement	N... it's complicated.
This medal was my grandfather's. He received it for acts of courage. For excellence. It's a tribute one man gives another. I could give you a job, Dwight. Why not let me give you something even better?	It's a job interview, not a flea market.
Dwight, the job is not right for you. Now, when something comes along that is right for you, I'll try you out. Now get the hell out of my place.	Yes.
Michigan. The President of the United States is "P.O.T.U.S." John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath.	Oh, ugh. What is this, a meatball? Really?
Wow.	Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the-
Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?	Ugh.
Duh.	Aw, man. This is not very clever, Jim.
Oh, you weren't going to do that?	Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
Andy's confused. That's not what I was hoping for, but it's not so bad either. I can live with confused. I get confused. I totally get confused.	Thirty-two meatballs.
To madness.	That idiot's been feeding us for a week.
Toby! I am Bacchus, god of wine!	Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
Hey, Dwight Snoot.	What-
What you doing?	I'm relaxing. Scram.
Come on, don't you want to play?	Oh really?
Yeah.	Yeah, you want to play you little hick?
Oh!	You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
Stop it. Dwight, I was flirting with you. I was trying to use you to make Andy jealous.	I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it.
Stop.	You stop.
No, you stop.	No, you stop.
Is he looking? Oh. You can stop.	Okay, you can stop.
No, no, no, he's not looking.	No, you can stop.
I've been working out. But, the problem is, I've been building muscle underneath. And that top layer hasn't burned off yet. Awkward stage.	Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...
Andy's not even looking. I think sexy eating is a dead end.	Damn it.
What is the most romantic possible thing?	We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
Andy, Dwight and I challenge you and Jess to a chicken fight. Winner take all.	Chicken fight!
Dang it! What the heck already?	Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
I'm right here! Cold. Cold. Come on, Cath.	Yeah- oh!
Yes! Woo!	Woohoo! Yes!
Dwight, our chemistry is really clicking. We work so well together.	I know. I could just bang you right now.
Yeah!	Maybe we should take a little break.
Dwight, we've got this. I promise. I will not leave your shoulders, no matter what.	Okay.
Mush, mush, mush! Come on!	Go!
Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-	Erin, did we win?
Sure. Sure we did.	You're lying. We didn't win.
Shut it, Angela.	Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.
Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.	I know. But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
Mmm.	So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.	Not what I asked.
We're done. Erin and I are over.	So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With s*x.
Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.	You're an idiot.
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?	Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.	Of course you found him not guilty. "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm."
It's okay, honey. It's okay, it's okay.	Not coming, have plans.
Ah! Angela had the baby!	Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.
Why?	Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
Would it be more hilarious than Angela having a Chinese baby?	Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
A little bit, yeah. Right guys? Back me up.	You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
Oh, did I win the pool?	-and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "I'd like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
Well no one won the pool. Angela wasn't due for another month.	And then I inserted my penis-
Oh, I'd love to but, um-	Into your-
Well Kevin and I have to go, Accounting is its own little family.	v*g1n* and-
Everyone, our very own Angela-	Admit that there is a chance.
Oh, I am so in.	Admit it. Admit it.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-	Yeah.
Yeah, my car got smashed visiting one of your clients and I had to have it detailed and they took my meter change.	Before I go, may I?
Yeah.	Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.
So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.	I just might be his father.
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?	I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.
Jim.	So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...
Hey, we'll be just fine.	And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
Oh, whew!	See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. Busted, Halpert!
Okay, wait, wait.	Oh, right. The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
Oh, right. The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.	Yes! Andy, get out here.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.	Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.	I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.	Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?
What's up, gangstas?	Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.	I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.	I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
Here, right there. Down the hatch.	I really don't want to take the chill pill.
Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.	Okay, okay. But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu.	That's good enough for me.
Where you want I park?	Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you.
Uh, I'm going to say "I" when I'm talking for Ernesto, so instead of "he says blah, blah, blah," I'm going to say "I say, blah, blah, blah," but that's for him. Anyway, it was something like, "He remembers Toby." "I remember Toby."	Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
The empanada guy!	No, Toby! Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. Ask him if he remembers Jim.
He says, "No."	He says, "No!" Boom!
Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.	Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.
Usually I'm a burrito guy, but if you won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.	Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
Why? Everybody's heard it.	Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.	Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?	You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.	Your clients. They're all mine.
Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.	All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself.
Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.	No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye.	That's it? This is crap!
You've reached Gabe Lewis, I'm currently indisposed. Leave me a message. Ciao.	Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.	I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best
Dwight. Hey.	Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
He went to the car or something, but he'll be back.	Okay.
Don't you want to see the baby?	Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
I promised I wouldn't tell.	So don't.
Angela got pregnant before the wedding.	What?
She got pregnant before the wedding.	How long before?
A month. You didn't hear it from me!	Yes I did.
Dwight.	I want to see the baby.
Oh, Angela will make you cut your fingernails. It's not worth it.	Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... willingly, or as slaves.
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... willingly, or as slaves.	That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose s*x, that baby is mine.
Hey guys!	Orientation is over.
Thanks. Nice flowers.	What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
Extremely, but I'm gonna fight through it.	Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.
I don't know what that is, Pam. I made a batch with no nuts, special for you Kevin, right here.	So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.
Babies sleep a lot Pam, if you feed them enough. Brownie Pam?	Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
I wouldn't know, I'm watching my weight. Ugh.	It did, it did.
...we wanted to say thank you-	Oh, I like it.
Dwight, I have exciting news for you.	No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.	What?
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?	You can't tantalize me.
You can't tantalize me.	Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
Oooh, maybe I can. I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...	I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.
I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.	OK.
Me neither. Hey, will you put this coat on my chair? I just realized I'm not going to need it down there.	If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
No, no, no, no. Just put it on my chair.	Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
Alright	The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly
Val knit me a beanie. But I can't if it's a "we're just friends" beanie or a "I'm hot, you're hot, let's get it poppin'" beanie. So I'm gonna up the ante, give her a clearly romantic gift, and we'll get to the meaning of the beanie.	Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.
Really?	Mm hm.
Ooh, me three.	Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?	God, you're such a spy.
"I'm glad you're in my life. Happy Valentine's Day." Ugh, Darryl. I am glad to be in your life too. Oh, your card is more beautiful than the gloves.	My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?
Kathy.	Kathy.
You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?	Yes.
Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?	Oh my god.
They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.	Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.	Oh god.
You have your team.	Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.
Back off! I got my reasons.	May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?
Why?	Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
What?!	Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
It just feels like a slap in the face.	I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
We're not questioning his reasons. I just wanna know what they are.	I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
Well, he nailed it because I do deserve a vacation. Sometimes Batman's gotta take off his cape.	Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
What are the criteria for going?	It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
Mooshie mooshie.	Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
My baby is not a monster!	Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.	OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.	Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
Five to six hours?	Three to four hours.
No no no no.	Two to three hours...
Nope.	Come up with a statement in the next hour....
I am...	I have already picked my team
Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.	Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
Because I feel like that I'm in a place with my gambling rehab that I can finally start going to dog racing again. You know, just sitting, watching, enjoying the sport? Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's like a crazy mismatch or something...	Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
It has been a long, lonely winter.	Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA
Florida Stanley smiles. Florida Stanley is happy to go to work. Florida Stanley is who you want on your Florida team.	Maybe it's what she does here...
I do. I really do. I think it would be a nice way to clear my head.	You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
Exactly.	Well, No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?
Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.	I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.	Jim is essential to th-
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera.	Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
Essential.	This is stupid! Cut.
Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.	He doesn't even want to go.
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.	Oh my god.
OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida	What?
....Stanley..	No.
...Ryan...	No!
...Erin...	(Bleep)
...And, Jim.	You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!	Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.
Why is it so hot in here?	Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
But...	But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
No no, I want to go.	Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?	SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.	How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?
How did a mosquito get in here?	I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes.
I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes.	Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says "I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt" unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, oh. What was that?
Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says "I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt" unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, oh. What was that?	Today is the first day of Sabre's new project to develop a chain of retail stores. I am meeting my new boss, Nellie Bertram, head of special projects. Work starts at nine. Sabre HQ is thirty minutes away, driving the speed limit. Giving everyone twenty minutes to shower, plus fifty for Jim to style his hair, twenty for breakfast, forty for Erin to get lost between her room and the lobby, ninety for Ryan to do his morning ecstasy... We're already twenty minutes late.
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.	Wake up!
Wake up!	Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wake up! Ow! Why are you sleeping that way?
Oh. I was reading the mattress tag and I fell asleep.	Stanley! Wake up! You've got to wake up, the hotel's on fire!
Mmm! Ugh!	Good morning.
I am on the two kid sleep schedule so I'm up and at 'em at four fifteen, but no kids, so I honestly didn't know what to do with myself, and then I thought of something. Uh-	Heeeere's Dwi- what the-? Oh man.
What do you think happened?	Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples. Oh no, no, no, no. It wasn't me. I gotta find Luwanda at The Alcohol Club. Oh.
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.	Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.	I need to make Nellie see me as a leader today. First impressions get locked in forever. When I first met Pam, she said something that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.

Since then I've loved working with Pam and she's frankly wonderful, but I hate her.	I'll have a bottle of the antacid. Also, I want to get a souvenir for my son, but his mother doesn't acknowledge my paternity. Do you have anything for that? Also, I want it to have a Florida feel.
What does he like?	Power.
Okay, and this one is, "Huh. Don't see too many museums around here."	Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
Hey, are you okay?	I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.	Very funny, Jim.
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?	I'm gonna set your face on fire.
Still queer?	Packer.
Let me just get the projector working.	Uh.
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.	You didn't poison me, it's just stress.
Okay.	What is the antidote?
Jim, help me lower this screen. You're a big, tall man. You'd be hilarious trying to do it, like a little boy. Just let go of his balloon.	I'll do it! I always say, "You want something done right? Ask Dwight." Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head.
I can do it.	Mmm! There we go.
Mmm! There we go.	Yes, a complete inability to pass gas, pervert. Ugh, yeah, it's tender. It can't be appendicitis, I eat more than enough bacon. Okay, what poison mimics the symptoms of appendicitis? Oh, you don't know? Hold on. What kind of poison did you use?
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.	Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone. Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
Sir? Sir, where should we send the ambulance?	Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
Totally. I mean, I'd never bang an animal, you can hardly tell the difference between a boy or a girl, you know, but hunting's intense.	You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
Did you say "masturbator?"	I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
Why are you sitting down like that?	Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
I feel like I'm in ancient Egypt.	I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
Dude, I think you have appendicitis.	Ahh!
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?	Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
Dude, don't you yak on me. This shirt is Van Heusen.	Stop moving!
No one's moving!	Oh!
Oh, oh!	Arrest Jim. He poisoned me.
Two or three days.	Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
Drama queen, am I right?	Phillip, if you're hearing this memo, that can only mean one thing, I'm dead. You are the rightful heir to Schrute Farms. Please, you must do one thing. Kill Mose before he kills you. Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
I'm acting like I like reception and I'm a really good actor, so people are actually buying that I actually like reception, but, I mean, seriously, reception sucks. Oh, there's the phone!	I just got out of surgery. What's going on? Fill me in.
Well, we broke into groups and the groups are doing presentations later.	Who's doing the presentations?
Packer's giving one. Jim'll probably give ours, I guess.	Damn it!
Very good point.	Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
Dwight, are you all right?	I'm great. How are you?
I'm great. How are you?	What's our presentation about?
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.	I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
Do a hundred jumping jacks.	No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine-	I want that vice-presidency.
You haven't done any of the research.	"You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name." You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
Yup.	All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
Ah, what is your topic?	What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
Retail consumer habits.	Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.	Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?
I can field this one.	No, sit down. "Seasonal." Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point. Thank you. Oh, God. Next slide.
Are those the lyrics?	Anderson's three pillars of retail. Crucial. So important. Next. Are there any questions?
Convenience.	Ingredients.
Service.	Burgers.
Building loyalty.	Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one
Very true. Where there's a will, there's a way. I once spent a passionate night with Hugh Grant's brother, John Grant. He's older than Hugh, just a little bit uglier. How did I pull that off? Sheer force of will. That is very good, Dwight.	Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
You are bleeding through your shirt.	Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face. Ah.
How are you feeling?	Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
Can I see the wound?	Oh God.
Oh! That's disgusting. That's barely healed.	You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
A few hours ago, your body was open like a cabinet.	That's right.
Oh, yikes. Incoming-	Ah! Not so fast.
It would be an honor, ma'am.	I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.	I had two goals today. The first was to make myself the clear candidate for vice president. I achieved that, no thanks to my appendix. The second was to find a memorable souvenir for Philip. For that, I do have to thank my appendix.
Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?	We wait. Come to papa.
News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.	Nope, I wasn't bitten.
That is where we disagree.	Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
No, three-month-old humans don't do that.	If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
Angela is such a liar!	No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.	No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
No one said "you must have two"	Such a chorus girl.
That's great.	Euughh... Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present... Hey.
Euughh... Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present... Hey.	Pretty good.
Hmm? No.	That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
Okay alright. I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.	Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
um... I mean-	That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.	Waste of time.
Yes, I can. uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just... we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.	That's just a verb.
nan	Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
Play it cool, man. She'll come around.	English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. You're crap. You're wonderful. They're mean, but they're incisive.
Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.	Okay... Seven, one, one, nine...
...ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.	No, okay.
Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.	Try again... Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one... is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
Try again... Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one... is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?	Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ... What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.	Wait, the numbers!
Wait, the numbers!	That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
What happens if you're the hunchback?	oh...
oh...	Oh, you get kicked.
How many buttons do you have?	There you go.
There you go.	(takes out bag) 40. Always.
Can I see?	Seven minutes.... Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card..
Seven minutes.... Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card..	Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)	Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
1434-967, paid.	No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
That's it, last one.	Aah!
Oh, no, I didn't know.	Where's the bug?
You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.	Stand back!
Hey.	It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
I'm dying!	I think I saw it!
Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.	You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
I will be here.	Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.	Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
Dwight? Hello? Dwight?	Well, saddles... ... sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.	Don't let-shh!
Don't let-shh!	If anyone's having s*x with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
Like I'm on the beach.	Seagull.
Impressive.	Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it
You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.	You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? ...ahhmmm... excuse me... What?! Not now, I'm busy.
I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.	Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no... Freak, I need a favor.
Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.	I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
What's in it for GSL?	You really want Packer as your boss?
Got it.	If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.	Where did you see it?
I haven't seen anything.	We gotta find it before it eggs.
Jeez...	Describe it.
Brown, shiny, painful bite.	Could be a bat weevil... Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.	Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.	Pshh. That's a bedbug.
Yeah.	Everything's a joke.
I know.	Check your hair!
Ow.	God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Just check it.	You are clean. Okay... One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide I am going to generate myself into a human trap. When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing.
Alright.	Yeah. Cover me!
He knows what he's doing.	Let the bedbugs bite!
Alright, then I will catch you later... What do we do now?	Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
You think you're so pretty!  Well you're not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!	Yes.
Take that!  Not so pre-violent anymore!	Yes. Yes.
Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!	We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ... what's lower than dirt?	Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it.  We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it.  We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.	Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn't even get a callback.	Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
The black one. I never stood a chance.	Okay! Come on!
Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.	Hah! Yah! Boom!
Hah! Yah! Boom!	Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
Yep	Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing â€“ bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love â€˜em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
When people see this presentation, they're gonna in their pants.	Okay.
Seriously disgusting.	Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.	Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player.	Perfect casting, right?
I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.	Speaking of pimples, let's release the BLOGGERS!
I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done.	Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There's plenty for everyone!
Quit it.	There's plenty. Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
I was ahead of you!	Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of Pyramids.
Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.	Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing.
Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing.	Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?	You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck!  Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.	Point it towards the store, idiot!
Point it towards the store, idiot!	You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.	Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
Take that, kid.	Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
Patty Grossman. I'm a woman.	But you still work for Wired, right?
Yes.	Good! Okay. Flirt away.
Yeah, no, Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?	Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
You know what?	You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
Dwight.	I'm trying to make him feel important.
God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.	Um... Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
You're so ignorant. You barely know what you're talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.	What's a book?
Oh! "Fix" means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!	Jim, get him a water.
No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!	Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Oh...	Have you seen Erin?
I'm on break.	Oh God...  Hey no! Where do you think you're going? You've gotta stay for the big presentation we've got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
When's the presentation?	It's moments away. Just stay here!
Well...	How long has he been in the bathroom?
About ten minutes.	Jeez! What's he doing in there?
Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?	Are there any bloggers around?
What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here?	I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
What?	That's right. Will you just give us a second?
That's....	Jim --
I'm not doing the Presentation.	Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you... if you don't do this, I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim.
Okay, I'll do it.	Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes.
A costume?	Of course there's a costume!  Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
Of course there's a costume!  Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.	Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
I've been in here for 20 seconds.	Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
I'm not wearing eyeliner.	You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
Time. Space. Gender. There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. No, that's --	It's true.
This... is the future, because... This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain.	Yep.
ahhhhhh	Psst.
Aw, I missed you.	A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
I missed you.	Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da!
Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.	Ah!
I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.	You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples.
Oh, that reminds me. Little something from all of us.	Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. Four! Oh yeah!
He doesn't even care.	Don't even care!
All right. So... I guess this is it.	Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But... bye, bye. I win.
Goodbye, Dwight.	Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo!
I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight.	Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
Bravo, Dwight! Very good! Shame.	The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre to the power of two.
I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.	I told you.
When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-	You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
All right. There he is.	What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?	What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'?
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should-	You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell.
Nice. Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?	Silence.
Aw, I'm just trying to-	I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.	Different guy.
You know, I just think you should know that-	That you look like the world's tallest hobbit.
Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. Again.	Showtime.
Dwight.	You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?	Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.	Jim, come on.
Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.	Uh-huh.
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.	Wait. He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
Yes.	That's two things.
Dwight, please.	Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-	You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
Dwight, come o-	Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah!
Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah!	Help! Help!
Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?	AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Gross!	Ah!
What? What, what, what, what, what?	Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
I'm sorry.	My wound hasn't healed yet.
I'm so sorry, I forgot.	Oh, man!
You all right? You ok?	Rrrah!
We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine.	Huh, huh, huh!
What are you doing?	I was trying to go-
Get up.	Ok, ok.
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.	Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
OK. What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.	Jackie Chan!
What are you doing? No. No, no, no.	This. Ends. Now.
This is dangerous.	Rrahh!
Why?	Anything else you need to talk about?
Nope. I think that was it.	Once again, it's show time.
You don't have a toothbrush?	My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
You just use whichever one is sitting there?	Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here.
Yeah.	Right here.
Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.	What?
What?	How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
Dwight, should she be our manager?	I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.	Those who can't farm, farm celery.
Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.	I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.	What?
Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?	There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
Then you accept it?	Five percent. No less.
Absolutely not. Seven percent.	Six percent, I know my worth.
The raise isn't real.	Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.	No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
No.	Yes.
No.	Yes.
No.	Yes.
No.	Yes.
No.	Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.	Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.	Well fought. I accept the outcome.
Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?	Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
I'll do it.	Yep.
Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya?	Yes!
People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-	Okay scram, wizard.
Nellie, really, nine fifty?	You heard me!
Bye guys.	Okay, okay.
You don't even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!	Why Jim?
What is it? I didn't sleep well last night.	Ugh! Ow.
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.	Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is."
That was one time-	I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.	Haulin' cube!
Andy! Hey!	I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
Yes, you should.	Ooh.
"Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie."	I have to see these shoes.
I doubt that they're sh-	Oh!
Whoa. Who is this guy?	Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
Boyfriend.	Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
Like a boyfriend?	You read my mind.
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.	Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.	Why not call...
God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.	That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.	If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
No.	Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?	I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
When you lost the manager job-	Yes?
Did it affect you outside of the office?	How?
I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?	Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
Oh, okay.	Okay?
Okay.	Washington Monument.
Oh.	Eiffel Tower.
I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.	One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.	Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.	Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
What do you mean?	Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.	It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?	No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now.
Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.	Yeah Jim.
I know, right?	You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.	You don't like the Beatles?
That's... That's not the point!	Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!	I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
What's going on?	There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out	That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male "hanging out". Call the cops!
How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?	I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
No! It was my idea to not be raped!	Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.	You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.	How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!	It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute!	Yes! Thank you!
The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute!	Oh yes! Yeah!
A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!	Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here!	Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!	Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something
Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?	Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don't you just take estrogen? There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? Mwah.
Oh!	Oh, I bet you think it's all about core, huh?
Oh, gosh.	Oh, please.
Oh, god, Pam. Don't get me started.	Feast on this, Lewis.
But sometimes he talks about flesh... and bacchanals.	Oh, thank you.
Erin.	Very funny Jim.
Yeah, hello?	I don't need your help.
You're blackmailing me.	Here, here... Just...
All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.	What?
What?	Good, we have a deal?
Thanks Janet.	How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don't even care about nationals.
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don't even care about nationals.	Thanks so much Earl.
I don't know. I've always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?	And they said it couldn't be done. Boom!
Hey, hey, come on, language.	Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
In the fridge.	No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?	And you are...
The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.	Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to â€“ how do I put this â€“ steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.	Yes.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman.	There he is. That's Lloyd.
There's actually not a rule that says that.	That's true.
No.	Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could've choked so many people by now.
Robert's here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don't think we were doing that.	Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim's leg.
Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems... so poorly timed.	Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Listen, Robert, I don't have time. There's a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions â€“	Don't listen to him.
Used to be Binghamton's â€“	Nope.
I want it, it's mine.	Prestige is ours. Okay, they're responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
We need you to make a decision.	Make a decision.
Is it just me or is our boss a freakin' weirdo? I'm gonna get some air.	Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
He's running!	Damn it!
Damn it.	Wha â€“ what is this supposed to be?
It's a monkey.	Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
Hold on, hold on. Is this him?	What?
Is that him?	It's him! Do something! Get out!
What? What am I gonna do? I don't â€“	Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five second delay.
Dwight!	Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?	Yeah.
Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.	Hit the nos.
Are you sure?	Yes.
Brace yourself. 3... 2...	Got it. Go.
Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe... you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.	Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.	Ahhh!
You all right?	Yeah. Oh.
Dwight, what are you doing?	Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
What are you talking about?	Just run! Take the stairs!
I don't even know where the stairs are!	I'll stall him. Go!
What are you doing?	I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours. Oh. My pants fell down.
What?	My pants fell down! I don't have a belt!
My pants fell down! I don't have a belt!	Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
What's going on?	Well â€“
Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse â€“	I was here first.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.	I already made an appointment... with your secretary.
Let me stop you all right here. I've already picked a new paper supplier.	Wait, it's not D.M Utica, is it?
Give me a cup of coffee.	Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
All right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us, so... we're still on the same team. Let me get these.	No. Let him get his own. It's Syracuse money.
You know, your partner's got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?	Jim couldn't land me in a thousand years.
But you're saying there's a chance.	Shut up.
Pleasure.	He's searching out younger gays.
Please.	...with you.
May I say one thing?	You okay, Robert?
The quality of mercy is not strained.	Put some ice on it.
Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?	I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, "muffin basket." Then I thought, "What's even more precious to people than muffins?"
If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?	...their own children.
Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.	Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.	Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.	Wha-? Damn it, Jim!
And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.	Hello.
Aw, come on. What's the harm? Mmm. What flavor was that?	They're testing it now.
The coconut's pretty subtle.	Seventy-two hours.
I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- ooh, hold on a second. Oh.	Yes.
Wait, C-R-A-Z...	Great, right up there.
Great.	Up here.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Jim, right here, right here. Okay, good.
Oh, so that's it?	That's it.
See? That wasn't so hard.	Cute kids, thanks for coming.
Thanks.	Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
Dwight.	Nice to see you. May I hold him?
See the duckie!	Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.	Really?
Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.	Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
I guess we're okay with the fingernails.	Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.	He defecated, aw.
No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!	Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?	Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
Andy's coming back today! Andy's coming back today! Ha! Andy's coming back today. David Wallace sent him on an outward bound wilderness adventure for a whole month to make him more decisive and confident. He sent his own son too. And the counselors said they both grew up, big time.	How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.
No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.	I don't see it.
Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?	Yes, yes I am.
Dwight, Jr!	In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson.
Now I know why Michael hated you so much.	Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!
Yep, body by Cheez-it	Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?
I think I'm busy that night. Or I would.	Well, we're both just kinda learning as we go, aren't we?
Learning what?	Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
Kay.	So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
Is thisâ€”is this like code for gay stuff? Cause if so, that's totally fine. Like, I'm fine with it. But you should know that I'm into the ladies.	Spoken like a true root man.
You know, if you're ever swamped, I could make some sales calls for you.	My calls?
So could you give me a list of all your clients? Or just the leads that you haven't had time to pursue yet?	You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
Yeah, I'll just give it a glanceâ€”	Ok
I'll give it a read.	With my leads and stuff like that?
Yeah.	Cause you're interested in going into sales?
I am.	Wow, that's great. That's great. Ok, good, let's talk about that, ok?
Ok.	You're not getting my clients! Nice try.
You're not getting my clients! Nice try.	Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.
Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.	Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.
Done. Explain.	The new guys. Dwight Jr is after my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.
Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.	Wait, salesâ€”what sales meeting?
The new guys called one.	The new guys called a sales meeting?
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?	There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
Hey, yes.	Boo, unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo!
Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?	Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.	That's not true. Just give me another chance.
This is a bloodbath. Alright, I'm calling this.	What?
It is enough of this. Everyone, let's go back to work.	This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. Idiots.
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. Idiots.	Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope!
Dwight!	Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
What are you doing?	Come here, I'll show you.
Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing. Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.	Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it's literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.
I will?	You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say?
Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.	So you'll do it?
No.	Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.	Come on.
Exactly the way it is.	No, Pam.
Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.	Please? Please, Pam?
Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis.	I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive.
Kay.	Ok.Oh, god.
Ok.Oh, god.	Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!
Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. Yeah!	Woo! Ahh!!
The building's custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.	No, no. No spoilers. Please.
Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning and... you see what chore you get that day.	No.
That's really nice.	Oh god.
It's open.	Yeah.
OK.	Yes.
I know you don't really exist.	If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
Darryl! Ha-ha! What's happening?	Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
Ah, thank you!	Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
Think so.	No, like you.
Thank you.	You're the stupid one.
Yes, thank you.	You're the stupid one.
Who's that?	You, you, you, you...
Dwight, what about you?	I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
Dwight, you will be participating.	No thank you.
Participation is mandatory	Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
Great, thank you.	Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
Oh, for goodness' sake, Dwight.	Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
Dwight, I cannot have the Taliban on the roster of Operation Give Back.	Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome.
You support the Taliban abroad. So I assume you're willing to live by their rules here.	Anything else would be inconsistent.
Will you join me then in a pledge to live by Taliban law in this office?	Absolutely, I will.
Absolutely, I will.	I feared Nellie had some sort of a plan but she used a ridiculous font. Huh. You don't have a plan.
Looking for this?	What the?
Oh, this is a lovely pen. Ah. But, it's mine now because I stole it.	Gimme that.
Didn't you sign a contract to live under Taliban law? And now, there's been theft. That means, you're not serious or... someone's getting their hand cut off.	You're insane.
I know. So, it's better that you pick another charity.	Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
In that case, you... will have to chop off my hand.	This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
I tell you what. I need to make three calls. And then after that, you can become a person who chops off people's hands.	Sounds like a plan.
Yeah, I know, I heard. I heard.	This is it. Any questions?
Is it gonna be long?	No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.	Heh! Ha!
Someone who's already got rapport with Erin, maybe. I don't know.	Ha! This is for real this time.
This is his fault. It is not your fault. I'm gonna find you someone better, and rich.	Who are you?
You know what this is all about.	You're not Jim. Jim's not Asian
Yeah. Go on, spill it. Tell her all the gory details, youuuu sssnake!	Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?
I still can't believe he didn't tell me.	How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!
Do not care.	You don't work here! You're not Jim!
Hmmm!	I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. This is Jim!	Oh myâ€”! Oh dâ€”! Oh, how didâ€”? Huhhhhh!
S"il vous plait...dites-Moi...Ugggghhh les Bleagh!	Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
I'm just trying to fit in better with Andy's family. They all speak more than one language. Usually when I'm there!	You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.	Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.
Dothraki is the native tongue of the nomadic war-mongering horse lords of Essos as featured in the superb Home Box Office series, Game of Thrones. It has a lot of nudity. Which I fast-forward through to get to the chopped-off heads.	I could teach you if you want. It's a lot easier than French.
Yeah! Let's do it!	Atherozar!
Oh!	It means "excellent". And we have begun.
Well somebody owned somebody. And I don't think anybody would buy an Andy.	I throat-rip.
Foth aggendak!	You throat-rip.
Foth aggendi!	He/she/it throat rips.
Foth aggenda!	More of a, barbaric growl.
Forth aggenda!	Louder! You're shouting it from the back of a horse!
Addor!	Daraas!
Qazer!	Daraas! Does anyone here have fermented mare's milk?
Dwight, you didn't tell me you were teaching me a fake language.	People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
Dwight's grandfather was aâ€”.	Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So...
I was gonna say he was a tax evader.	Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
Yeah, thatâ€”you're being really mean, Andy.	Yeah, Andy.
Andy Bernard presents	I'm barren, Jim.
Fail.	My trouser hives are void of honey. I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
A blooper reel? What is this, 2005? I look like Bob Saget? Fail! Who's this guy?Look at him dance. Fail!	You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?	Fail!
I deserved that.	That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done.
I think I got it right here.	Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
Fail! Fail! Fail!...	What position did you use to conceive?
Ok...that's not...	Oh, god.
Oh, god.	Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
British women. Famously overemotional. Am I right?	Nothing! Nothing is going on. Keep moving please.
What?	OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
Oh my god!	You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Um, OK I'm just walking into this. Am I to understand there is a bee hive in the wall?	Bildenkinder.
It's pretty good actually.	OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
Yeah?	Oh, the wires need insulation. It's a wire people. I'm not buying it a fur coat.
You got it.	When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
Andy, could I have a word please? Um, it won't take a moment. It's extremely important and it really has to happen now.	Oh, better than OK. You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
A baby what? A human?!	Everybody! Hang on!
You did it.	"Statistical correlations exist between EMF radiation and various health hazards. But mainstream studies are inconclusive!" That means you can't make me do squat.
Yeah.	You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls. We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
Well, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just gonna say it. I'm nervous. I have no idea what health problems this is all gonna cause.	What? Come on.
I'm not gonna grow a third arm!	I know what Jim is trying to do. He's trying to get big bad Dwight to shell out for a huge repair job while lucky Jimbo gets a paid vacation. Well sorry, lucky Jimbo, I can live very happily in a magnetic field. Most of my childhood heroes got their power that way.
"Side effects of EMF include	Had 'em all my life.
"..breast pain..."	No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
Oof. "Infertility."	Yeah right.
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?	Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot. What the?
What?	Some of these kernels have crowned.
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag... Oh my god.	Andy!
Ladies and gentlemen, I have heard your complaints and we reached a settlement.	So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
Nice job.	In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
What?	Bring it in!
Bring it in!	Roll into the future with Work Bus. Say goodbye to wasteful buildings. These days a mobile office isn't just for hotshot politicians. Now anyone can rent a work bus. If you've got a parking lot, a work space is just a phone call away. In this age of belt tightening and less empowered workers, a work bus is how tomorrow gets things done.
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that. Really? Smirking?	What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam. Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?	It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
No question.	No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?	Get your foot behind the yellow line.
Well, it's the...carry the four...and...it doesn't work.	I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.	That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
No!	Stop ordering me around, Jim!
Pies!	OK, fine. You win. Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go. Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
Banana cream is the first to go. We'll be lucky to get pumpkin at this point!	This year I decided to really get into the spirit of Halloween.
You thought I wanted to sit in the audience like some slutty Treb rat? A man's signature solo is his for life, okay? That's group policy and you know it.	It may have been the costliest decision I've ever made.
Look, it's not my fault that I still live near campus, and it's my duty as an alum to be friendly to the young guys., and stop in two, three times a week.	My greased up head went into the pumpkin no problem, but ...
I tell you what, we'll have a sing-off for it. You pick twelve alums from any year to back you up and I'll do the same, and I'm so confident that I'll win, I won't even warm up.	I can't get it out. Try again!
Fine, go ahead. Thrash your pipes.	I mean, I could try destroying the pumpkin...
My pipes are primo, Champ. Why don't you ask Trey Anastasio about my pipes?	Jim, no. No. No! No!
I knew you would go there, you son of a bitch!	But as Jim and I discovered... No! ... any blow to the pumpkin itself could prove fatal to me.
He said, and I quote, â€˜Hey Rob, nice pipes'. That happened!	At first I drove myself crazy thinking about the things I should have done differently. I never should have played that joke on Erin. I never should have hollowed out this damn pumpkin in the first place. Then I realized that I was being silly. I mean the pumpkin should rot off of my head in a month or two. Right?
Well, um, you know maybe you're the wise old guy that the new uh, B-O-N-E-R champ looks up to. You know, you could just--	What lab did these little clones escape from?
Yah! ah. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. But you have no idea how lucky you are because HCT is doing a set at our halloween party.	I want some of those pills.
I do. I love the boss's interests.	Oh, no. No, no, no. no. They're not for me. They're for my cousin Mose. He's just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.
Where you boys stayin? How does it work in the rooms? Do you get a privacy partition?	Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
You know what I just realized? They might actually call me up to solo on George Michael's Faith. That was one of my signature songs. Oh, man. That would be insane. I'm so not prepared.	He says Thank you.
Okay.	Jim. Look I'm eating you.
Shut up.	Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. I'm eating Jims.
nan	Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!	Oh no, I'm spilling Jim all over the carpet.
Stop it stop it stop it stop it!	Hello little pill. What do you do?
Hello little pill. What do you do?	Dumatril is licensed to treat anxiety symptoms, such as panic attacks, excessive worrying, and fear. Translation
Gross. I love it.	Dumatril!
Something wrong Dwight?	Dumatril.
Yes?	This is a pill that I found here in the office. But it's not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. It's not for any disorder of the body. It's for a disorder of the mind.
The mind is part of the body.	Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane... They are now off their meds.
Dwight, our co-workers' health issues are really none of our business so-	Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? What's going on Nellie? Talk to me.
Yeah, you're right. This man needs to be apprehended.	I'll get my apprehension kit.
All right. Awesome. Cool.	Hi Daryl. I'm just here to smear some peanut butter on my forehead.
You know, to uh, to protect his brain from the nanobots that the government put in the air conditioning.	That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
I can't really picture it. Can you... get it on there. Yeah. And maybe, get the cheeks.	So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
Get under your chin first. Yeah.	Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
Take it all the way up to your lip, yeah.	Is that how they like to get in?
Yeah, that's crazy.	I don't know. I just don't know.
Hey.	Hey.
It's funny right?	All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
Okay, look Dwight, let's just call this thing off. I mean, it's just an anxiety pill. Lots of people have anxiety.	You think I don't have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes I've got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And ne'er- do- well siblings to take care of. But I don't need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
Cool. Free upper.	Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
Don't dog catch me!	Gotcha! Yeah! Let's see ya get out of this web, huh?
The pill is mine.	What?
Get her out.	Oh.
Show some pride. This is crap.	I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.
Good? Come on. Above and beyond. World's Greatest. You did this! Dammit I'm happy!	I do! I do. I do. I do. I do.
Yes, I am very pleased I did help Andy. Would I have gone with him if he'd asked me? On his sailboat cruise to the Caribbean? Yes. I think it would have been really fun and romantic.	The media can make you famous. And do you have any idea how easy it is to sell something when you're famous? "Uh, yeah wow. 10 reams of 40 pound bond at only $690 after discount? Um, whatever you say, Brad Pitt." It's that easy.
Hey. She's back.	blah blah blah, rat tat tat tittle tattled and prattled on about the little metal bottle, she spat a bit of spittle...
Yeah, no problem. How was it?	...In a bitter battle..Hey, hey! Stop questioning my methods, OK? I was chosen for this task for a very good reason.
Hey, some buddies of mine are going to Poor Richard's for beers and pool, you wanna come? I can't promise you too much, but uh, you might get to meet my friend flipper.	Tricky siskel spat a bit of wicked biscuit....
Awesome. Have fun.	Vroom! Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin. Good. Sounds- This is Dwight Shrute.
And welcome back to Biz Whiz. I'm Iris Black. On the line we have Dunder Mifflin's senior sales associate Dwight Shrute.	Iris, thank you so much for having me.
Let's do it!	Iris, let me tell you. David Wallace is the CEO, but he's not hands on.
So the day-to-day operations are entirely under your command?	Entirely is the perfect way to describe it, Iris.
Uh, excuse me. I'm being told by my sound engineer, Steve that uh there is a clinking sound coming from your end. Does your shirt have buttons?	Yes..?
I'm so sorry we're going to have to ask you to remove the shirt all together.	Now then, we were saying. When my workers-gather-
Oh, I'm so sorry. I am told we are still having problems Mr. Shrute. Your voice, it's sounding a little feminine.	That's impossible.
Yeah, Oscar's in big trouble.	OK, how is my voice now?
I'm getting the all clear from Steve, so Mr. Shrute, what is your response to the consumer product safety commission that says Dunder Mifflin paper is toxic?	This is gotcha journalism. You know what? They're not gonna gotch me.
Well, you've gotta do what you've gotta do.	This is slander, Ms. Black. Slander I say! I dare you to produce one credible source about this.
No the paper's not toxic.	Thank you Sandra!
Unless it's exposed to oxygen. Then it becomes extremely toxic!	Do not listen to her! This employee is obviously disgruntled!
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!	Get out of here moron!
Excuse me, Mr. Dwight, who are you talking to?	uhhhh....no one.
Did you just call Ms. Mick a moron?	No, everything's fine.
Are you insulting my guests?	nan
Oh that is nice. Classy move.	That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
The fallout from this morning's revelation continues to mount, since Mr. Dwight Shrute began speaking, Dunder Mifflin share prices fell 73%. Mr. Shrute, shareholders demand accountability from corporate leadership. Can we announce your resignation at this time?	My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
Good afternoon!	Please sir! Spare him. Please.
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!	Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.
Hello?	David, is that you?
Dwight?	Oh, thank god. Oh, thank god. Are you ok? Is everyone ok?
Yeah? Are you ok?	Oh, I'm OK. I just want you to know that I believe in you. I really do. And I believe in your ability to make the right choices. I always have, David.
Well, thanks Dwight.	You're welcome, sir. But David, listen to me carefully. I'm gonna need you to let the mailman go. Ok?
Dwight?	Walk out of the house...
What?	...with your hands on top of your head, everything is going to be fine. Dunder Mifflin will be in good hands while you're away in prison.
Ok, Dwight, gonna ask you to not call my cell anymore. Gotta go.	Wait a minute, you guys? You heard?
Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute! Shrute!	Shrute! Shrute!
Shrute! Shrute!	Overall, I'd say my first radio interview went pretty much the way I expected.
He's been sailing for two days.	Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I've got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
No. No! Nooo!	You're the Quizno's. Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn't quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?
I -- I --	Dwight Schrute. Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?
Dwight Schrute. Well, hi there David Wallace. Why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town?	Hmm?
I don't recall. And yes, Molly is crap.	And you didn't call Jim - that seems significant.
Jim, good! You should hear this too.	He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.
He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.	No, he shouldn't.
Go ahead David, I'm listening.	Very good.
Very good.	Okay, David, I want to take you off speaker but... I don't know where I'd put you.
Jim Halpert.	The White Pages.
Hey, it's Colin.	The White Pages
I know. Don't worry about it.	I'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second. Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where's Stanley?
It's just... it's not totally working.	Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
Yeah, well, it's not just not ideal. I mean, with you there, I don't know how we're gonna do this.	Yeah! Okay. Hey David, I'm back.
Oscar, what is happening here? Why would you say you think the senator might be gay?	So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
Look, look, look. Here he comes. Here he comes. What is he doing?	Her name?
Oh. Oh.	Shhh! Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.	Good luck to you.
Dwight, you can't go. You have a problem with women. You can't sell to them.	Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can't be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can't be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.	That is a damnable lie. I love women.
Gina Rogers at Apex Technology said you called her â€˜gy-na' for your entire meeting.	Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
Yeah, she said she corrected him five times.	That's all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
That's all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.	â€˜Gy-na' said that?
Guys, we can't let Dwight blow this. An account this size could double our growth. That means raises, bonuses... Pizza Friday could come back.	Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. It's like air to you people. Ugh, God.
So, uh, show us how you'd normally sell to a female client.	Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
Okay, you just walked into her office and begin.	Hello.
Hello.	May I please speak to your boss?
I am? Hmm.. Hi, I'm Mr. Hannon. How can I help you?	Okay, this isn't working for me, â€˜cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
Oh, I'll be the buyer.	nan
Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.	I never sit down during sales meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
No actually, she likes to take her time discussing her needs.	I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I'm finished, it's over.
Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?	I thought it went great.
Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?	Yes.
Okay, well you have to show us.	That's impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don't vibrate at all.
Huh. Uh huh.	What are you doing?
A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?	Kind of.
It's just up and down, just a regular nod, like a person.	I am a person.
And then we thought we'd ... I can't. I just can't carry on with that face. Look at it. I'm gonna get nightmares with that face. I mean he looks like he's laboring over a stool having just eaten human flesh.	That's a bit extreme.
Oh, all right. God, Dwight, just ignore every instinct you have. It's all garbage okay? You're the woman, I'm the salesman, watch what I do and try to learn.	Okay, I'm a woman. I'm a woman. Good?
Ms. Thomas, so good to see you.	Hello.
Oh, are those your kids? They're so cute! They could be models.	Thank you. I'm so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my v*g1n*.
You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.	Look, I have no problem with women. It's businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don't lie about your shoulders!
Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?	I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber.	Okay, I can do that.
Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.	He used to fight dogs.
Like, he used to make dogs fight? Or he actually fought dogs?	Little of this, little of that.
Okay, great.	Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
Oh my God. It's Jan.	Oh, dear God in heaven.
I was under the impression that David Wallace would be coming. He bought back Dunder Mifflin, correct?	Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off.
I thought it would be fun to have a little chat with uh, David Wallace after all these years. Oh, well. What are you doing?	Listening.
Stop.	Sorry.
Stop that.	Okay.
You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us.	Yes, she is. Now, I may not have any instincts with women, but I have an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I'll be right back.
No, thank you, Angela.	No.
If you chase me, I will run so fast. If you catch me I will bite so hard. Got it? Good-bye, my friend.	Well, well, well, it's finally happened. Pam has ceased caring.
These are my painting clothes.I think I'm gonna do it. I am really gonna start painting the warehouse mural today.	See ya later, Trevor.
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?	I just saved your life. You're welcome!
Ugh!	Oscar.
Oscar.	Come on in, the water's fine.
nan	I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes.
Yes!	Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband?
Well, a woman who struggled with obesity all her life.	All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?
Wow.	Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.
nan	I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text.
Yeah!	Text went through.
Okay.	You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid.
You're not stupid. Jazz is stupid.	All we can do is sit and wait.
Okay.	I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey.
I know. You're gonna be okay, Monkey.	Oh, look at that. Yeah, he's free anytime. Not a problem.
I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.	I don't like him either.  And yet I really like him.
Make it go taller.	Where does gayness come from? And how is it transmitted?
Obviously. He's a sweet kid, Darryl. But he's not the sharpest guy in the drawer.	Is it called red-vining?
Huh?	We heard it was called red-vining.
People red vine.	Get in the van.
Get in the van.	Where are gay mens' vaginas?
Is it safe to talk?	What?
What?	Well, this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years, but I don't see them so I think we're good.
So what are your credentials?	When two gay men have s*x, how do they know whose pen1s will open up to accept the other person's pen1s?
Do you have a gun?	Does he own a gun? Show her.
Read the receipt. That's a $300 gun. Someone could steal it.	Do you have any idea how many guns Trevor's had stolen from him?
Now I keep it in a safe.	Mm-hmm. Good safe?
Oh, you tell me.	Wow!
All right.	You get half now and half upon completion of said job.
Okay, that's the big one. That's the big "M."	You can't have someone murdered.
What if they deserved it?	What did they do to you, Angela?
They're sleeping with my husband.	Oh, Monkey. Oh, I feel for you.
This seems a little crazy.	Yes. Crazy. Thank you.
But I think I'm up for it.	No! No!
Thank you.	Absolutely not. There are a lot of different ways to get revenge. I've had great success by defecating in a paper bag, put it on the porch--
What about a knee-capping?	No! You're not helping, Trevor!
Yes, a knee-capping could work.	No. Angela! What are you saying?
You said you would be there for me.	I'm trying, but what you're asking is--
It's the only thing that will make this right.	Okay. But it's cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn.
What? Why did you call me out here?	The target-- it's Oscar, isn't it? He and the senator are gaying each other.
I don't know what you're talking about.	Your nostrils tell a different story. They flare like that every time you're engaging in deception. Hello again, naughty nostrils.
Fine! It's Oscar. So what?	Well I could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked. But a co-worker-- Dare I say, a friend?
Exactly, a friend. Someone who sits next to you year after year, making chitchat and smiling, and all the while running behind your back and defiling your marriage and seducing your husband.	I can't even imagine how painful this must be for you. But the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me.
Well, you might be right. But it's too late now.	What do you mean?
He's here.	No! No, no!
No! No, no!	Oscar? Oscar. Oscar, good. Hey come with me.
What?	Come -- come with me.
What are you doing?	There are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers, drinking diet sodas. You have got to see this. They're extraordinary.
Got it.	There's no time to explain. Okay, actually, there is time to explain. When Angela found out that you seduced her husband, we hired a guy to break your knee caps.
Oh, my God! What is wrong wiht you?	What is wrong with you? There are a million gorgeous guys in the Scranton Wilkes-Barre area, and you choose the man who's the father of her child?
I don't know what you're talking about.	Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about.  Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us.
Oh, don't lie. I'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about.  Now, let's get out of here. He could be right behind us.	Aah! Actually, he's right in front of us.
Let's get it on. I'm gonna do this. I might-- I might puke, but I'm gonna do this.	No, Trevor, I am not gonna let you. He's a Dunder-Mifflin man. He's my tribe.
I got it.	Disarm!
You don't--	Don't move. And disarm now!
Okay, okay, okay, okay.	No! No, Oscar. He's a friend. He's a friend.
I'm sure it's fine. it's a blue shirt.	Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight!
We found some old decorations in the warehouse. Oscar ran to the store for some food and drink, and I dipped into my stash of eggnog. I guess they needed me after all. It's like in it's a wonderful life when Jimmy Stewart realizes that all thos people at the building and loan were just jerks, and he was the real hero.	Uh, excuse me. Trying to get work done. Some people don't care about Jim's new sports job in Phila-Whatever.
Kevin. Kevin! Aaah. Stop it!	Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning "Love," and adelph, meaning "Adolf." "the city that loves Adolf." Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
So we're not going to have a Christmas party this year? Angela, how could you do this to us?	Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.
Well, you are the one in charge of it.	Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.
Yeah, let's not blame her for something we all forgot.	I don't care. Guess how much I care on a scale of one to ten.
I knew the party was today, but nobody asked me to plan it, so I didn't. Hmm, funny how that works.	Damn It!
Yeah. Definitely. Hey, what's--Oh, no, come here. Hey, hey. Come on, huh?	What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
No. I want Tropical Christmas.	No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.
What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?	Or, who was it that suggested the authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? I think it was someone really popular.
Too weird.	Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash!
Shh. Let's not speak of that. The Pig Rib! We could totally break the pig rib! I'm gonna dig it out of the trash!	This is me and my family celebrating Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas in 1982 on the farm. There's me and my brother Jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib. He doesn't come back for Christmas anymore. The sepia tint is from an app on my phone. This is the same photo, matrix style.
Party planning cimmittee, emgergency meeting. Now.	I found it!
I'm just hoping German terrorists don't take over this Christmas party. Make me go all John McClane on their asses.	Oh! Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.
Oh, that's okay, bud.	Very impish.
The party planning committee, minus Angela, has decided that we're all going to do Dwight's Christmas.	Yes! Yeah! Yeah! Okay! Yes! It's a Christmas Miracle! Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!
Dwight, there is one rule that you need to take very seriously.	Uh-huh.
And that is...	Uh, Oh.
That there are no rules.	You have never been cooler.
Thank you.	And Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas has officially begun.
Ugh. What is this stuff, lava?	That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
What is it? Don't touch it.	Somebody's found the hog maw.
Oh!	What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
Ugh. I'm not eating mystery meat.	It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib.
Weird. Where are the sugar cookies? Where's the karaoke machine?	This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces.
How would anyone even know--	Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
So happy right now.	Wait, what is that I hear? Is someone on the roof? How strange. Excuse me. I have to run to my car to take a dump.
It's the lining of the stomach of--	Ohh... Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
Yes, he is finally nigh.	I am nigh!
I am nigh!	Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.
Every year, my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at Christmas. He was...okay at it. I am great. You know how they say some people were born to be bad? Well, I was born to be belsnickel.	Ooh, belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year. Whoo hoo HOO hoo hoo! Ohh...Too much strudel.
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.	No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel.
And the fear.	Yes, exactly!
Come on, Dwight, you're making this up.	No.
Wow.	Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
Uh-Uh. No, Dwight. No.	Oh, come on. We don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions. Come on, get with the spirit of it, you guys.
Jim, that guy. You gotta stick to your word! Like when you say something to a buddy, a real buddy...what are you gonna do, lie? To your buddy? It's awful.	Take a bowl and pass it down.
Thank you, Dwight. These are nice.	No, these are gift bowls. When you recieve a gift, it will go in the bowl, but the bowls must be returned at the end. They're a set. Now, hold your bowls forward. The belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable.
Oh, it's like naughty or nice.	No, impish or admirable.
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?	I decided earlier.
Oh, nice. Did you check that list?	Of course I checked it.
But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.	I checked it more than once.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--	Impish or admirable.
Damn.	Phyllis Vance! Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as...admirable. There you are.
Oh. What are these?	It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars.
I'd rather have the bowl.	You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year...as impish!
Ow! You hit people with that thing?	No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder
Mouse trap.	In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
Oh, you know what? I gotta go.	Stop giggling.
Yeah, it's all right.	It's a punishment. Hey, where are you going?
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.	But you work tomorrow.
Yeah, I know, I'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep.	But we were gonna break the pig rib.
Ooh.	Remember?
That's right.	No matter! Belsnickel cares not about this--off with you!
Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody.	Wait, wait, wait, wait! Don't you want to know your present?
You know what? Yeah. Have at it.	Jim Halpert. Cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year as impish.
Ooh! Are you nuts?	I judge you impish!
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.	They're not abandoning the party.
That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!	Impish!
Oh God, Meredith, lice? Did you not sign a pledge to shower?	What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.	Just lice Pam?
Just lice Pam?	Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.
Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.	Make way, nope, inspect me.
Oh, this is the cleanest scalp I've ever seen. You are all clear.	Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.
What are you wearing?	It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
No.	Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time. I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.	Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!
No, no. It's more of a nuisance really. It's not that big a deal. So, I collected your hats and your coats...	To be burned!
What do we do about our heads?	I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
Okay.	Let's talk pubes, people.
Once it's all over your head, just leavr it there for four hours. That will be enough time for the lice to fall asleep, suffrocate, and then pass away.	Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right.
Put those away before you hurt yourself.	Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
Yeah yeah, Princess Fancypants let Jane 12-pack over here take the fall.	She's right Pam.
Is there a volume knob on that thing?	Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
Who's the one who didn't bring lice into the office? Meredith. Sure I gave everybody pink eye once, and my ex keyed a few of their cars, and yeah I BMed in the shredder on New Years. But I didn't bring the lice in. That was all Pam.	Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...
Dwight, are you okay!?	Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple.
I'm back together with Val. Yay...	I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere.
Well I can't stand here if you pull the carpet out from under me.	Stone and Son Suit Warehouse recently lost their paper provider. They're a family owned business. Jim and I used to clean up at those. We'd go in pretending to be family â€“ brothers. We did it at a family owned law firm, at a family owned construction company, and a family owned motorcycle store. Jim and Dwight Shrupert. I was the dynamic, likeable winner that was doted upon by Mom. And Jim was the closeted foot fetishist pretending to belong. The client never knew any of that, but I knew.
Oh, my head is killing me. Does anyone have a baby asprin?	I hope you've been paying your wig storage bills Jimbo, because it's time for another episode of "Handsome and Stinky, paper brothers for hire".
It's all gone. I didn't get a chance to try them all because Creed poured my Bogota Sunrise in the plant.	Oh, god, this again? You're Stinky.
Shut up!	Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
Everybody shut up and work!	Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. See what you leave me with here, Jim?
Yeah!	How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
Hey, it's five o'clock.	Mmm. That's a good... question. 300 times... 180... Um that comes to 25 minutes. Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
Heading to Philly. Interview with Jim's company.	Yes! We did it!
Why don't you come along and tell him yourself?	And you closed it. The boys are back in town. High fives! Ha ha!
Mhm. Cover that. What does that mean, exactly? What are we talking here? Details.	You got me! I used to collect them!
What? Everything? What, how do I make sure it's in order? I haven't been trained for this.	Each one is very different, like a snowflake.
Actually, it's pronounced "espresso"... Wait. That's what you said. I apologize, I just assumed you would mispronounce it. So...	There he is! We are all so proud of you for the small part that you played in landing the white pages. Prouder of me, but...
If you really want to show appreciation, just give me half the commission.	Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh... No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
I loved it.	How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
If it'll lead to me being a salesman, I'll pretend to be your friend.	Then looks like we have a deal... Son
It's kind of funny, a father and son sales team meeting with a father and son suit store.	You know, you're right! We hadn't even thought of that, had we boy?
No, we sure hadn't Pop.	Oh! You're a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh?
He calls me Clarky â€˜cause he's my Dad.	Guilty!
My dad is the best hunter there is. I mean, he's like a serial killer... of animals. One time, he snuck up behind a sleeping deer and just sawed its head right of. It was sick!	It was his birthday, just turned three. So...
Actually, you know what? Give me one second, okay? Make yourselves at home.	...But I think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that Clark's getting out of my car. He's a good boy, does whatever I say.
I can't relate to that, my son hates my guts.	Oh... really.
Bring him into the business, and he resents me. How do you like that?	Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that they're not even good. Really, they're bad. Like you and your son.
Here you go, Pop! I know it was just a couple minutes, but... God I missed you!	What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
I sure was. Just like he taught me, looking cool.	You're being disrespectful!
...And I love you, for saying that.	We don't get along.
Ha ha! I just burned him. Because the truth is... our relationship is... terr-	Terrible!
Terrible.	Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!
Well, I understand, but â€“	I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
Listen to him. He created you.	Maybe if you listened a little bit, you'd improve. No wonder women despise you.
Women don't despise me...	His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adam's apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldn't see it, or didn't wanna see it.
Alright, that's enough, â€˜cause I can say some things about him too.	Yeah? Like what?
Like the time that you got drunk and, and then... Killed those kids on their way to prom!	That never happened. He's always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught "saving treats" from the kitty litter box.
So we can offer you matte or glossy printing-	Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
There's obviously a volume discount uh, if you-	Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going "please kitty, may I have some more?" You can't make this stuff up!
Here he is, my son.	Got cat turd collector written all over him.
I'm sorry, you guys are here to sell us paper?	Do you mind? The men are talking.
Sons used to idolize their fathers.	Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?
Okay Pop...	Wait, so you're the boss?
That's Italian silk. Very comfortable. Very tasteful... Although expensive.	Yeah, you don't want Italian. You'll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you'll be doing life in Rikers Island.
Well, that's better than looking like the undertaker from boring island.	That place doesn't exist. It's not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
How do I look?	Actually... You look great. They steered you right. I guess it does make sense buying from a father son team. You know what? I'll take one too.
Everybody dance now...	Gotta clear out these file cabinets people, a lot of these are dead accounts. "Scranton Mimeograph Corp?" I don't think we're doing business with them any time soon. That's odd.  A letter from Robert Dunder. "A valuable artifact has come into my possession. I have hidden it until such time as a person of strong intellect may safely recover it. This golden chalice is of immeasurable historical and religious significance." The Holy Grail.
Hey.	Aha! A lightbulb.
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it.	A lightbulb. Okay. Okay. Invisible ink.
I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.	"Higher than numbers go." The ceiling above accounting!
Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.	An "X."
Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video.	Oh.
Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it.	"Sedes introiti." Seat of entrance.
I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.	nan
Yep.	Let's just forget it. Forget it.
I nailed that guy, dude. Oh yeah.	Pfft, "Athlead"? Please. They're too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it "Stumpany," for "Stupid Company."
Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go! I nailed that guy, dude. Oh, yeah.	You're working for "Stumpany" too?
Yeah, just weekends for now, but pretty soon, I'm switching over.	What?
Yep.	Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end?
Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.	You won't stop until you've poached us all.
Yeah. Even you.	No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me.
Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh God. Andy has just started to be nice to me, I just sent his girlfriend into the arms of a younger man.  "Our social media presence should be hot, hot, hot. Go at it vigorously." I did everything but unzip their pants for them. Oh, God, Nellie.	Hey, everybody. Uh, coffee order is going around -- on me. Just sign your name below.
nan	You're welcome.
Wait. This says "Dunder Mifflin Loyalty Pledge"?	This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.
Come on, Dwight, stop overreacting. I'm getting all my work done here. No customers have complained. Nobody even knows.	Yeah, we'll see about that.
Yeah, we'll see about that.	Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? "Infuriating, irresponsible"...
They got us set up with Windows 95,  so you're kind of dreaming here.	Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out.	Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean?
Ooh, it's when you get a free sandwich after you've already eaten ten sandwiches.	Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.
Thank you. Thank you.	No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl?  L--
Loyalty.	Loyalty.
Loyalty is exactly right.	Thank you.
I'm sorry. Do I still need to be here?	Yes.
I'm having a bit of trouble understanding the importance of loyalty. So let's-- let's use an example. Take Erin. Erin's boyfriend Andy, is away across the ocean.	Yeah.
Shh! Kids are dancing.	Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?
Dwight, look, I'm sorry you're having a hard time with this, okay? Athlead is my future. No disrespect to Dunder Mifflin, but if I can have fun at work, I want that.	It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products.
It can.	Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?
All right, let's get this over with.	You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! Here we go! Yeah!
You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! Here we go! Yeah!	Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!
How far is this place?	Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports.
I just remembered... I kissed that man. Oh, no. Oh, no.	Yes. Fast food. I'll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.
They have fast food in Philly.	Not like this.
And your milkshake.	Thank you.
It's 30 degrees out. You drinkin' a mildshake?	Nope. Fire in the hole! Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!
Nope. Fire in the hole! Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!	Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
You just threw a milkshake in a restaurant where they make minimum wage.	It's a youtube thing! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, they're coming.
Hello, Peter.	It barely even feels like a prank anymore.
Fire in the hole! Go! Go! Go! Go!	Ha ha! Yeah, joke's on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
Lady...you never stop surprising me.	nan
nan	What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?
Hey Brian, you got a sec?	Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?
I feel awful.	Okay.
Hey, so I hear you're bringing in some people to interview for the sales job?	They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.
They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.	That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.
I'm good.	Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.	Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee.
Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee.	Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, "Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses." Wow.
You know what, man? I deserve this job.	nan
nan	Mm-hmm.
I scored Stone and Son Suit Warehouse with you, and God knows, to get the Scranton White Pages with Jan, I went above and beyond... and under.	Who, me?
Who, me?	You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.
Us.	Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor â€“ he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants.
Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor â€“ he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants.	Absolutely, I do.
Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that.	Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.
Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.	Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that's great.
nan	I chose my words very carefully.
Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse.	Aah!
No. You're interviewing for it. I'm getting it.	Welcome to the club, pig!
I'm Rolf. Rolf Ahl.	Aah!
There he is.	Hey. Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first. You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F, you're literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor.
Nice.	Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.
Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix â€“ me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash. So... problem solved. Thanks, guys.	And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!
I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.	No doy!
I hope you like Norwegian black metal, because I don't do earbuds.	No earbuds!
It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.	So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything.
Well, a lot of that information is private. How do I know you're qualified to evaluate me?	Well, I'm the one offering the job.
What are your credentials?	I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.
I think I've heard everything I need to hear.	Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference.
Thank you, Dwight. I'll be in touch.	Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, "Jump," and he says, "Oh who?" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.
Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, "Jump," and he says, "Oh who?" He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.	What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?
Ooh, okay. Didn't see that one coming. Can I take a 20 on that? Maybe we can circle back around to it.	Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.
Pass. Next one.	All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?
No, no and no.	There were only two options.
Checkmate. You win this one, my friend. Do you validate parking?	This is a bus transfer.
I looked at you coming around, and I said, "Wintergreen."	I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.
I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.	Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock. You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.
That's just a classic no-win situation.	Thank you.
So I'd Kobayashi Maru it.	Damn it! Perfect answer, again.
Yep.	Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond ...
You know what, Dwight?	And anothâ€”
This interview's over, and I get the job. I just Kobayashi Maru'd the whole process.	No.
Yeah. Star Trek rules.	It does, but still no.
Come on, man. I mean, did Trevor do that? Did Rolf do that?	Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here.
Walked right into that one.	Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise.
Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise.	What quality would make you a good sales associate?
People person.	It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.
That's right.	You know we live together, right?
Yes.	And I've never seen you go to work, ever.
Okay.	So why is this on your resume?
X-Men school?	When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.
Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some inputâ€”	This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.
Hey, Dwight. It's David.	David.
Jim says he'd like some say in the hiring process.	Really? That's interesting. â€˜Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.
Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.	Sounds fair to me, David.
Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later.	No. Why not do it now?
Uh... Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?	I'd love to be in the loop, David.
Yes, okay. Bye.	I'd love to invest.
No, thanks.	I'd like to give you $100 million.
Dwight, you can't just hire someone â€˜cause they're your friend.	I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.
They're freaks, Dwight. All your friends are weirdos and freaks.	You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.
Man, how cool is it gonna be when I start working here? Paintball fights at lunch.	Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.
Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.	Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of â€˜em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.
Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of â€˜em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.	Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.
Do you want this paper?	I sure do.
It's not very good.	I will pay you whatever it takes.
I think I wanna keep it now. It must be pretty special if you want it so bad.	No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.
Stop trying to get my paper buddy. Okay read my lips. It's over.	Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?
I am.	Okay. Good, good, good.
I have eight years experience selling electronics in Sanyo store in downtown Tokyo. I was a doctor. And I have a business degree from Tokyo University.	This isn't gonna work out.
Thank you.	Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps
Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps	No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them.
Do you need to be changed?	I do that myself now.
Mm. Are you going to make a decision soon? I've been double-parked for five hours. I'm wondering if I should move my car.	No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.
Yeah, whether it's me or Troy Underbridge, or Gabor, or Melvinaâ€”	Or none of you
Can you imagine how insulting that would be? The contempt that a person like that would have to have for you.	I wish I could hire all of you.
I could start Monday.	Psst. Jim Jim? Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.
Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'. That's what I always say.	Just act natural.
Just act natural.	And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.
But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.	Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call.
Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?	I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.
I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.	Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.
Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?	Yes. Thank you. Amazed.
I'm sorry?	What? This is such bullcrap!
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.	Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?
Too much now.	Okay.
Do we get our resumes back or do you keep them? Because I only have the one, and I have a chili recipe on the back that I really wanna keep.	Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.
No. We get it. Thanks so much for the opportunity, Dwight. Don't open any suspicious packages you may receive. No, wait. Do open them. Totally safe.	Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.
Conference room. Everybody. Now!	You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.	You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
Yeah.	Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.	Pam, I'll help you.
You will?	If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.	You need my pitchfork?
Hey!	What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
Exciting news. There's room for one more at my son's birthday event. And, I want you.	Ah, I'm not interested.
What? Wait. The state transportation secretary will be there. You could sell your beet salt idea to the highway people.	If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics.
Aw, crap.	I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.
You're gonna to compare 'um to the butts up there.	Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
All right then, they're bottoms. Uh, we should ask you to do big, rounded Ws.	Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.
OK, OK. I think it's time to get back to work. Come on, fellas. Let's go.	Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...
We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.	We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. Nate. Your mother is dying.
See, I feel bad about that.	It's all right. It's all right.
So, she's gonna pull through again? That's great. Can I talk to her?	No. She needs her rest again.
Now listen. Now that we have got you here, let's talk about this mural business.	You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
All right. You can go. Give him his gum.	There's no gum. There never was any gum.
That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.	Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
We should just take him down.	Wait. Are you saying...
I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.	Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.
Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.	He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.
Yes!	A little eye for an eye action.
Yes!	Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
We need an infiltrator.	I know just the man for the job.
Clark?	He even looks like a mole.
Oh, crap. Were those yours?	I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?
Well, my only crime was loving the local sports teams and trying to be one of the guys.	Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
What lines?	Go move some paper!
Oh, great! His truck!	Great. Get the plate number.
OK. Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?	So we know which truck to van...
I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?	Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.	Let's see yours.
Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.	This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.	I saw that. That's great!
Yeah. I feel better.	Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.
I know. You miss Angela, don't you?	Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his pen1s.
We're breaking up. And just so you know, I was worried that you were dead. You were gone for three months.	Come in.
Hey, Andy. It's David. Still here. What was that about three months?	Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.	I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.	I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.
Actually, we're not gonna make it. Um... we're splitting up.	I have yet another sales order for you to sign.
I have yet another sales order for you to sign.	Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.
Hi Dwight.	You're back. And you're disgusting.
Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin. Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe.	Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.
Why? Isn't he just coming in to rip you a new one for being gone three months?	No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.	Thank you.
And you sold it to Jan too.	Yes!
I mean... I'm impressed.	Yeah!
Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.	You were on a boat.
I was...	On a boat.
That...	In the ocean.
OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? Just say the word 'coolio'.	I'm not gonna say it.
Say it.	Not a word.
Coolio.	No! What do you think you're doing?
Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.	Don't you dare! Andy!
Hmm.	Coolio.
Seriously? You're calling me a few weeks after finalizing our contract to gouge me now for more money? Is that what you're doing?	Coolio. Coolio.
Yeah.	Coolio.
You know what? You know what, uh, Nard dog? There is an option in the contract that allows me to back out within 30 days of signing. So, I would like to exercise that option.	No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
Well, ah, ah...	Please Ja, Ja...
Uh-huh... Uh-huh. Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.	Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.
He just waltzes back in here like he owns the chunky, lemon milk. Who needs him, right?	God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.	I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.
Guys. I know that a lot of people are mad at Andy and, believe me, I am too. But, he has been through a lot and we all used to love him, right? So, if he's gonna get in trouble, just let it be his fault not ours. I don't want that on my hands.	Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.
I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.	Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
You know Pam's mural? Well, Frank...	... lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.
What?!	Yeah.
There was a fire in the warehouse?	The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.
...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!	Yes ma'am.
You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that's just being Pam. Well I'm kinda cute and I'm- but I'm married so...leave that be.	No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
Hey. You got a sec to talk?	I need you.
Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.	And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.	It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.	You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was "poisoned" by Aunt Shirley.
Yeah.	Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
I do think we can have a fair....	Thank you.
Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don't- not allowed to ask. So...	Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
You're not.	And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.	There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
Don't be afraid, it's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-	It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.	It's a divet...
Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show?	..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.	How dare you?
I'm Kevin.	Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.
What, do you two know each other?	This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
Oh.	OK
That's so random.	You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
Hello beautiful.	Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.	Ok.
Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.	Yeah, trust me.
So Pete was a librarian?	It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.	And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?	By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
Hmm.	Would you like the stink sack?
It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.	No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.	Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
Call you right back. What were you saying?	Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line.	Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
Bye.	I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
I made a vow. I gave my word.	In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.	Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
Good night, D.	Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
It is so unpleasant. You?	No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
You're definitely hoarding this by the way.	It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
Austin Powers.	You'll see. Here we go.
Ferris Bueller.	Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
Not Night at the Roxbury.	Let's get to it.
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?	Give it a whirl.
He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.	I need you to hose my aunt.
Mmhm.	OK you are useless.
I don't know.	Give me the hose!
I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.	Ahh! OK!
Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.	Hold it!
Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.	I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?	I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.	My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
My condolences.	Keep them.
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?	In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
Oh, thank god.	Excuse me?
I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...	OK. That's not...
I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.	I really hope so.
OK. This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.	I miss her so much.
OK.	You know?
Zeke's here.	Zeke.
'Hi' to Mom.	Are you going?
Will there be ghosts there?	Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
You get in the sidecar.	Get...
Get...	What are you doing here?
You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.	Oh, yeah.
Who is that?	Jeb, my brother.
You have a brother?	Uh-huh.
Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here.	Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all.	Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow.	Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Would the family care to say something?	You had black hair and then gray hair.
I see you started without me.	You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
Blugh.	Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. What is this? Oh, god. Henry.
Dwight.	I see Esther's back in town.
Hi Dwight.	Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn.	Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here.	OK.
Land size? Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's. OK.	So, let's get it going.
Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this.	We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city.	Thank you.
After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out "worm" means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of... pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management.	I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
Snap out of it. Dwight?	Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy?	Of course you are.
Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication.	Oh my god.
Totally. Yep. The people here are like Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart?	You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt.	You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
That doesn't work on me.	OK.
By the way, that's not...	nan
Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui.	Oui.
Oh my goodness.	People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them?	Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
I was just asking you something I didn't know.	Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
Are we gonna eat these today?	If you want.
Is that a guillotine?	This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
That's a cow?	Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
What are you doing now?	Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
I don't know.	Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
I don't know any of that.	OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
Not it.	It. That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
That'll pay for the exploding helicopter.	Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
Yeah, that's better. A bunch of hot women go	Phyllis is m*st*rb*t*ng. In the office right now as we speak.
I don't know how we'd go about doing that.	OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this.
We'll look into it.	It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.
We're gonna go get him.	Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
We're gonna get him.	Esther Ruger.
Esther Ruger.	Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.	Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.	Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.	Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.	By hand.
Dwight, we need to talk.	What do you think?
What do you think?	I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends.	A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.	No.
Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.	That snake!
Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.	That shady grove out by Willard's pond.
I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.	So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
Um.	No!
You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?	Post hole digging.
I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that.	Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
I bet she does. I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.	Did I tell you about her teeth?
Yes.	Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.
Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls.	Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.
Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns.	Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
Esther, get in the truck.	Ok ok ok, wait! You win.
Oh! Seven new comments. "The guy at 0	Security deposit. That's been-
Standard.	Right, standard.
Hey, can I talk to you for one second?	No.
One second.	No.
One second.	I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
Don't do it.	What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
Dude, we're being conned.	Go on.
These chicks are way too hot to be into us. Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.	No.
Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.	What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
I don't even know what an auger is!	No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
Hey, you ready to sign?	I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me.
Didn't you get the memo? It's Stairmageddon! Come on Stanley!	Right? Come on!             
Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It's a... "Mageddon!"	Yeah, maybe I'll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it's the most pleasant I've ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.	Well, the alert was already set to "Red" because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to "Double Red"?
It doesn't include headshots.	What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news...thing.
It's okay. The hell does he know?	You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn't even know it. I'll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
I want you to print that out for me.	Wellâ€”no, noâ€”nâ€”
Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation's Lisa Loeb.	We need a winch and a hoist.
You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?	Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could've met in the lobby. It's time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
Son, you've lost your mind. I'm not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.	The buyer is your sister's friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that's an order.
All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I'm a better wife than that.	Andyâ€” I need to talk to you.
Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. 251. 252. I can't even keep up!	Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That's final.	So what I'm hearing you say is, "Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible"?
Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent.	Mm-hmm. Good luck.
Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.	For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts.
Hey, Dwight.	Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?	Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you haâ€”	nan
No, you didn't. Sick of you and yourâ€”oohâ€”	nan
nan	It's all right. Andy approved it.
Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?	Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do.
You gave him three shots.	Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. Grab his feet. Let's go!
All right.	Move it! One, two, three.
Move it! One, two, three.	He's like a manatee. Ready? Let's go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! Oh, God.  No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.	Yes.
Yes.	Okay, we're good. We're good. Let's go. Push!
Any good weekend plans?	I might see a movie.
Nice.	What about you?
Uh, I don't know yet.	Let's take himâ€”
I was thinking about...	Let's go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
And then what?	Okay, listen. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I've never actually done this before.
Well, if I may, you're a natural.	Thank you. I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh...
That's a little weird.	I know. Evel Knievel.
I know. Evel Knievel.	nan
That's about as good as that's gonna be.	Okay, now here's the plan. I'm gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Catch?	Yeah.
I can't catch him. He's like, 250 pounds.	You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He's gonna be moving slowly. It's onlyâ€”
Blunt?	It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicineâ€”
Dude, this size of my haunchesâ€”	Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.	You okay?
nan	Almost there. Almost there. Okay. We're running late. Let's get him inside.
We can't just leave him bubble wrapped like this.	Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
That's actually really smart.	Thank you.
God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.	Let's get him inside.
Hey, wait, wait, howâ€”how are we doing this?	Well, I'll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
Just say "arms" and "legs," okay? That justâ€”that's the vernacular that I'm comfortable with.	Fine, let's go.
nan	Hoist his shank on three.
Whaâ€”What's a shank?	It's by the tenderloin.
It's by the tenderloin.	Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he's slouching. Okay, can youâ€”sl-slouch him into the seat. Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt.
All right.	Got it?
Yeahâ€”yup yup.	Get in the back.
What?	Get in the back.
Aw, come on.	Get in.
Damn it.	Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we're about to do?
Pigeons.	Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we've got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Isn't the client, like, best friends with his sister?	New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let's go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let's go.
That they do.	And forâ€”oh, whoopsie daisy.
Stanley, what is going on here?	He's fine. He gets carsick really easily.
Driving.	It's a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we're talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
Ooh-hoo, look at that baby...	Stanley.
Very special little boy.	Look at him. I've never seen such a beautiful child.
Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he'll go, "eee."	Like this? Watch.
Bzzz.	Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest. It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. Practically made of plastic.
Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh?	I'm pumped!
I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.	I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now. She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
Yes!	Hey, that is a really nice plane. You make that yourself?
Uh huh.	Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
Oh man.	I call for a refold!
This is flatter.	It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
Nice.	Whoo!
Tom Brokaw!	Come on Clark!
Come on Clark.	Whoa!
No you can't baby! Good luck.	Watch and learn.
Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.	Yes!
Whoo!	Oh, Esther.
Hey.	What are you- You're here early.
Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow.	I like a little feather in my nuggets.
Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?	Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
Oh. Is she a gambler?	In a way. But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
I believe I want to go home.	Yeah! Ok! Beat that! Whoo! Ok.
Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.	After you.
Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight.	Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God.
We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely.	Alright.
It's great.	Just wait and send it to voicemail.
The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.	Come on. Come on.
Nice morning, too.	Dwight Schrute is manager!
Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.	Pam.
Tell me about it, you know? I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.	Thank you, Jim.
Is everything ok?	Get out of Jim's seat.
Wait, all of them?	You're an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we'll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
That'sâ€”that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry.	So...
I've never met anyone like that.	I wanted to offer you a new position.
Angela, you still have your son.	Assistant regional manager.
Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job.	Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. Basher, Thrasher, Crasher andâ€”
Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. Basher, Thrasher, Crasher andâ€”	Jim.
I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take.	Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.	Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.	I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.	I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.	So, all the numbers adding up?
Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but... congratulations, Dwight.	Ah! That's how it's done.
Ah! That's how it's done.	Thank you.
Lately, I've been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy's calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.	Yes, it is. Carry on.
All right. I get it.	You okay?
No, he's good.	He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
Good night, Kevin.	Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself.
Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.	Just slip it off myâ€”Slip it off my hips.
Wait a minute. You're not thinking of living in aâ€”	He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.	There it is.
Come stay with me.	We did it, we did it. I love you.
I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won't be long. It's the least I could do.	Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You're gonna watch me right?
Separate bathrooms.	Sensei, you're not watching.
You're welcome. Let's go get Phillip. Then we'll get your stuff...	Watching?
And get you the hell outta that place.	Watch this part, okay?
Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world.	Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
What?	You did not just say that! You don't know Pam. She is really cool.
Oh, my god!	Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It's out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see Jim as manager.
You come so prepared. Aspirin.	You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great.	Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job?
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.	Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed.
I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying.	Hello.
Well, hello.	Big day for you.
Big day for you.	Thank you.
Love the belt.	Oh, yes.
You know, I don't know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out!	This is exciting! You're finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Thank you, I appreciate that. â€˜Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.	Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who've tried to be a star. But, listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.	Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don't quit your day job.
Nothing is impossible to him who will try. Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.	You're bad.
Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?	Say it again.
Will you be the new manager?	Where?
Where?	What branch?
Here. Scranton. Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news.	I'm sorry. I've just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
What?	But this isn't interim manager. No. It's Dwight K. Schrute... Manager.
Why do you already have this?	In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
I know.	I will never, ever let you down.
Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schruteâ€”	David. Can I just do one thing while you're making this announcement and then I'll never, ever do it again?
I don't think so.	It's just one thing. Just let meâ€”let me do thisâ€”
How many people want the game? Who wants PBS? Sorry. Tie means I do nothing.	Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project
One more for the doc.	But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Yes!	This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.	The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
I feel scared a little.	Ah, much, ok.
No one is ready for this. You can't be ready for this. We don't even know what this is.	No, no. Give me the steam.
One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.	It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
Here we go.	Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
He ain't coming.	Oh, don't worry. They'll get got.
Oh, god!	Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check... on that later today. This is my grandmother's ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring.
Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?	You know what to do. Ok
Oh, oh, I'm sure we did.	Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.	Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World Warâ€”
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that's on me. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you're feeling sentimental.	Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Don't tell me what to do!	Welcome.
No, I don't need this! And you obviously don't need me.	Please take an agenda item.
Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.	Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. "Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try." That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Question.	Smart baby. That's the most flavorful bond.
No, I know.	What is going on?
Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.	Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
I'd better come out of this smelling like a rose. I've been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn't for the cameras, I would've done some truly vulgar crap.	Oink the pigs, that is very important.
Dwight, I'm telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?	I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.	The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.	Thank you, Esther.
Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you.	I need you to perform a test.
America wants it!	On an innocent baby.
Casey Dean!	Damn straight.
Man, those are some nice pipes.	Hey, he can handle it.
Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?	Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Why don't you pack it?	Okay. You ever been in a manager's office before?
Guys.	Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called "Schrute or Consequences." You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says "bold front" instead of "cold front"? It's insane.	Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America's Next A Cappella Sensaâ€”	Not now! Private time!
Okay.	Hey, hey! Seriously?
No, you're not, sir.	Which is, of course...
Please don't.	Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
I'm not touching you. Okay?	The power source.
Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.	A loyal, but bungling apostle.
A loyal, but bungling apostle.	That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
He's not that smart. He doesn't know where I hid his duck.	Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
What is this?	I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
No, you're a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.	I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
No, we do not want to hear you sing.	That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's the sanest thing I've ever heard.
That was a really cool move.	That means ye, Plop!
Whoa.	We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
No, Kevin, no.	You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
Whoa!	Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
Stop it.	You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it.
Absolutely.	Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.	Door. Chair. It's about Phillip.
Door. Chair. It's about Phillip.	Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job.
That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?	I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Ew, the exact opposite, actually.	Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet.
Come on.	Very well.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonnaâ€”	Yes.
Yeah.	Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
I would love a corn dog.	Now.
Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went."	Jim. I'm not kidding. I need you.
Jim. I'm not kidding. I need you.	No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations.
Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.	I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
What?	She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest.
Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?	Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Me too. Hold my place in line.	And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.	Angela.
Yep. Take care.	Some sort of virus?
Hey.	Oh.
Aha. How's Athlead?	You're a good assistant, Jim.
Wow.	That's very true. Get the hell outta here.
Thank you.	A thousand times more.
See you guys at Poor Richard's, all right?	No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
Okay, bye.	Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
Hey! No way!	Pull over!
Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.	Move to the side of the road!
Get upstairs, mister!	Pull over!
Guess I'm going upstairs.	Shut up, woman!
Who drives like that?	I know.
I know.	Listen to me! I love you! And I don't care that Phillip's not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Can you put that down?	Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-	This expresses how loudly I love you.
It's too loud.	Me.
Me.	This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
Okay, yesâ€”yes, I will! I love you!	Yes! Thank you.
Yes! Thank you.	I love you!
And I lied to you.	Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?	What?
Hey.	What? Why would you say thatâ€”
Are you happy?	Get out! I'm a dad!
What's it about?	The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?	You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet.	Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you've been here. That's the max.
Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you've been here. That's the max.	pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.

Hey, and if you're ever in Austin...	PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
Well, w...	Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn.
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay...in my barn.	In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a "where are they now" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go.

I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a "where are they now" panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go.	I heard you say "well" the first time.
There it is.	Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.	Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So... have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So...yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!	It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.
Speech!	No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
You did good. Real good.	No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is...for...Kevin.
Yes! Wait, why?	That's it.
I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. Someone should write a song about that.	Go ahead and just read the frosting.
"Get out."	I missed you Kevin.
Uh..ohh!	Uh-huh.
What does that mean?	Ohh.
Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes...and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's...an amazing gift.	It's a colloquial way of saying "you're fired," Kevin, which you are.
Thanks Phyl.	The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
Do you even have a mattress?	Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
Dwight...	You've had your drink. Now where is my bride?
Oscar. Oscar. I think I'm gay.	Based...on his merit.
Based...on his merit.	Mose! What..ooh, Mose.
I'm...good.	No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.	Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake. Bye, bye Toby.
I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much.	That is all. Have a good morning.
Yeah, people hate you.	What was that for?
Hey! It's Andy Bernard!	Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
Ree-De-De-De-Doo!	Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth. You keep forgetting about him.
It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it.	I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band "The Grass Roots" in the 1960's. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.

With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
Oh, um, well, you know, I... I just... I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.	Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight.
Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore?	Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?	You kidding? I was born ready.
Hmm.	Oh, no. What?
No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.	Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing.
Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing.	What? Ooh!
Surprise!	Not... significant is a big word...
Not... significant is a big word...	I thought you guys couldn't come.
Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.	I think you're only a teeny...
You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?	Jim.
Jim.	Uh, better ask Jim.
And Jim will say nothing.	Michael. I can't believe you came.
Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are...for real.	Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab â€˜em on in there.
Whoo, whoo, whoo.	Everybody!
Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.	Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary.
Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.	Jim...wha... Come on! What...what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
I don't know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn't look so good.	A bazooka. You remembered.
You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me?	. Get out of my way.
Oh, my gosh, it's choreographed!	Woo! Okay!
nan	Amazing.
People love it.	Good night.
Good luck.	Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Hi, boys!	Good evening.
Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. No offense. You going, Toby?	Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
You have to go, Toby.	No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?
Come on.	Oh, we do. So we'll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
There he is!	Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
I gotta get out of this dress.	Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good.
Hey, Darryl.	Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic.
We're so excited.	You're telling me!
Oh, that's for PBS executives only.	What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?
Okay, I need a drink.	Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow.
Hey, bottom drawer.	Good old Mose.
Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore.	Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural.	A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.

Hi.	Right. Which one is that?
Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?	Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!	Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? What is that meaningful look?
Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.	Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender! Oh.
You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...	I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
Athleap.	Why did you pick this place?
Ooh.	No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired!
